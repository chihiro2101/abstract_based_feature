with the discovery of fire , the earliest form of artificial lighting used to illuminate an area were campfires or torches firefly have been used as lighting sources a major reduction in the cost of lighting occurred with the discovery of whale oil the use of whale oil declined after abraham gesner , a canadian geologist , first refined kerosene in the 1840s , allowing brighter light to be produced at substantially lower cost the gas mantle boosted the luminosity of utility lighting and of kerosene lanterns the first form of electric light history of the carbon arc lamp ( 1800 - 1980s ) '.edison tech center , edisontechcenter.org over time , electric lighting became ubiquitous in developed countries segmented sleep patterns disappeared , improved nighttime lighting made more activities possible at night , and more street lights reduced urban crime the most important functions are as a holder for the light source , to provide directed light and to avoid visual glare a fixture using replaceable light sources can also have its efficiency quoted as the percentage of light passed from the '' bulb '' to the surroundings the more transparent the lighting fixtures are , the higher efficacy an incandescent bulb has a color temperature around 2800 to 3000 kelvins ; daylight is around 6400 kelvins lower color temperature lamps have relatively more energy in the yellow and red part of the visible spectrum , while high color temperatures correspond to lamps with more of a blue-white appearance for critical inspection or color matching tasks , or for retail displays of food and clothing , the color temperature of the lamps will be selected for the best overall lighting effect lighting is classified by intended use as general , accent , or task lighting , depending largely on the distribution of the light produced by the fixture task lighting is mainly functional and is usually the most concentrated , for purposes such as reading or inspection of materials general lighting ( sometimes referred to as ambient light ) fills in between the two and is intended for general illumination of an area led lamps or bulbs are now available to retro fit in place of high energy consumption lamps it is commonly used in lighting applications that require minimal glare and uniform general illuminance levels uplighting ( indirect ) uses a diffuse surface to reflect light in a space and can minimize disabling glare on computer displays and other dark glossy surfaces however indirect lighting is completely reliant upon the reflectance value of the surface lighting from the side is the less common , as it tends to produce glare near eye level backlighting is used to illuminate a background or backdrop forms of lighting include alcove lighting , which like most other uplighting is indirect this is often done with fluorescent lighting ( first available at the 1939 world 's fair ) or rope light , occasionally with neon lighting , and recently with led strip light soffit or close to wall lighting can be general or a decorative wall-wash , sometimes used to bring out texture ( like stucco or plaster ) on a wall , though this may also show its defects as well recessed lighting ( often called '' pot lights '' in canada , '' can lights '' or 'high hats '' in the us ) is popular , with fixtures mounted into the ceiling structure so as to appear flush with it it is typically a floor lamp but may be wall-mounted like a sconce the standard lamp and shade that sits on a table is general lighting , while the desk lamp is considered task lighting magnifier lamps are also task lighting this would probably fall under accent lighting , though in a dark nightclub it could be considered general lighting traditionally made up of small low wattage , low-voltage lamps in a track or translucent tube , these are rapidly being replaced with led based versions some manufacturers are designing led and photovoltaic luminaires to provide an energy-efficient alternative to traditional street light fixtures found online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 floodlights can be used to illuminate work zones or outdoor playing fields during nighttime hours delta snapshot : outdoor entry lighting found online at : last accessed 13 april 2010 these lights are installed for safety , security , and for decoration underwater accent lighting is also used for koi ponds , fountains , swimming pools and the like white rear-facing reversing lamps indicate that the vehicle 's transmission has been placed in the reverse gear , warning anyone behind the vehicle that it is moving backwards , or about to do so in the late 1950s , some automakers began to use electroluminescent technology to backlight their cars ' speedometers and other gauges or to draw attention to logos or other decorative elements commonly called 'light bulbs ' , lamps are the removable and replaceable part of a light fixture , which converts electrical energy into electromagnetic radiation each of these technologies has a different efficacy in converting electrical energy to visible light visible light output is typically measured in lumens roger fouquet , heat , power and light : revolutions in energy services , edward elgar publishing , 2008 , page 411 rating and marketing emphasis is shifting away from wattage and towards lumen output , to give the purchaser a directly applicable basis upon which to select a lamp lamp types include : ballast : a ballast is an auxiliary piece of equipment designed to start and properly control the flow of power to discharge light sources such as fluorescent and metal-halide lamp ( hid ) lamps fluorescent light : a tube coated with phosphor containing low pressure mercury vapor that produces white light halogen : incandescent lamps containing halogen gases such as iodine or bromine , increasing the efficacy of the lamp versus a plain incandescent lamp compact fluorescent lamps : cfls are designed to replace incandescent lamps in existing and new installations comparative study of energy saving light sources lighting design as it applies to the built environment is known as 'architectural lighting design ' lighting of structures considers aesthetic elements as well as practical considerations of quantity of light required , occupants of the structure , energy efficiency , and cost artificial lighting takes into account the amount of daylight received in a space by using daylight factor calculations for example , dark paint tends to absorb light , making the room appear smaller and more dim than it is , whereas light paint does the opposite lighting illuminates the performers and artists in a live theatre , dance , or musical performance , and is selected and arranged to create dramatic effects stage lighting uses general illumination technology in devices configured for easy adjustment of their output characteristics dimmers , colored filters , reflectors , lenses , motorized or manually aimed lamps , and different kinds of flood and spot lights are among the tools used by a stage lighting designer to produce the desired effects a set of lighting cues are prepared so that the lighting operator can control the lights in step with the performance ; complex theatre lighting systems use computer control of lighting instruments motion picture and television production use many of the same tools and methods of stage lighting especially in the early days of these industries , very high light levels were required and heat produced by lighting equipment presented substantial challenges modern cameras require less light , and modern light sources emit less heat the human eye responds differently to light from different parts of the visible spectrum , therefore photometric measurements must take the luminosity function into account when measuring the amount of useful light the device measures activity and light together at regular time intervals and electronically stores and logs its operating temperature daylighting is simply designing a space to use as much natural light as possible the international association of lighting designers ( iald ) is an organization which focuses on the advancement of lighting design education and the recognition of independent professional lighting designers

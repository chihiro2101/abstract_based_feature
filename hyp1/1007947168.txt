the concept of diagramming originated in the 1797 book “ senbazuru orikata ” , the first origami book ever published later books began to devise a system of showing precisely how a model was folded in the 1950s and '60s , akira yoshizawa proposed a system of diagramming he introduced its diagramming notation in his first published monograph , atarashi origami geijutsu ( new origami art ) in 1954 the yoshizawa–randlett system was first described in samuel randlett 's art of origami in 1961 there are two main types of origami symbol , lines and arrows a dashed and dotted line shows a mountain fold ( there may be one or two dots per dash depending on the author ) a dotted line shows a previous fold that 's hidden behind other paper , or sometimes shows a fold that 's not yet made reverse folds of a corner are typically used to produce feet or birds heads a squash fold starts with a flap with at least two layers ( for example , one flap of a waterbomb base ) make a radial fold from the closed point down the center of this flap fold two radial folds from opposite corners along the same side of the reference crease ; the resulting flap should be folded downwards so that the previous edges are aligned a petal fold starts with two connected flaps , each of which has at least two layers a petal fold is equivalent to two side-by-side rabbit ears , which are connected along the reference crease in origami , there is a series of several bases that many models are created with the fish base consists of two radial folds against a diagonal reference crease on each of two opposite corners the frog base starts with a waterbomb base or preliminary fold the open sink usually involves opening out the paper , and reversing creases to make a waterbomb base in the middle of the model the spread squash is used in the eyes of engel 's octopus , in marie 's rose , and in some other intermediate and complex models the closed unsink appears in some complex models , such as a few of lang 's insects almost every origami book has basic instructions and a set of folding symbols happyfolding.com site featuring instructional origami videos , an origami dictionary , etc .

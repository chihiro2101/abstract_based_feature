the concept of diagramming originated in the 1797 book “ senbazuru orikata ” , the first origami book ever published later books began to devise a system of showing precisely how a model was folded these ranged from an unwieldy set of symbols to a photograph or sketch of each step attempting to show the motion of a fold none of these systems were sufficient to diagram all models , and so none were widely adopted in the 1950s and '60s , akira yoshizawa proposed a system of diagramming he introduced its diagramming notation in his first published monograph , atarashi origami geijutsu ( new origami art ) in 1954 the yoshizawa–randlett system was first described in samuel randlett 's art of origami in 1961 there are two main types of origami symbol , lines and arrows the operations shown here are all fairly common the pleat folds and reverse folds are often done with the two creases at an angle reverse folds of a corner are typically used to produce feet or birds heads the sink fold is considered an intermediary to high skill a petal fold starts with two connected flaps , each of which has at least two layers make two radial folds from the open point , so that the open edges lie along the reference crease in origami , there is a series of several bases that many models are created with in general , '' base '' refers to any folded paper that immediately precedes final folding and shaping of the model-to-be the resulting square can then be used as the starting point for any base or blintzed again the open double sink is used in many box-pleated models the closed sink appears in some high-intermediate and complex models ( if this is tried with a non-conical point , such as the waterbomb base itself , eventually the fold will terminate in a spread squash almost every origami book has basic instructions and a set of folding symbols it has pictures of simple models at the start , and pictures of complicated models at the end

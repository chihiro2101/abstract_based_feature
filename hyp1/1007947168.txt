in the 1950s and '60s , akira yoshizawa proposed a system of diagramming he introduced its diagramming notation in his first published monograph , atarashi origami geijutsu ( new origami art ) in 1954 the yoshizawaâ€“randlett system was first described in samuel randlett 's art of origami in 1961 there are two main types of origami symbol , lines and arrows a dashed and dotted line shows a mountain fold ( there may be one or two dots per dash depending on the author ) a dotted line shows a previous fold that 's hidden behind other paper , or sometimes shows a fold that 's not yet made the sink fold is considered an intermediary to high skill the version shown here is called an open sink and there is another version called a closed sink which generates a triangular pocket with no flaps showing a squash fold starts with a flap with at least two layers ( for example , one flap of a waterbomb base ) make a radial fold from the closed point down the center of this flap open the flap and refold downward to make two adjacent flaps a rabbit ear fold starts with a reference crease down a diagonal a petal fold starts with two connected flaps , each of which has at least two layers make two radial folds from the open point , so that the open edges lie along the reference crease fold one layer of the open point upward and flatten it using the existing creases in origami , there is a series of several bases that many models are created with the resulting square can then be used as the starting point for any base or blintzed again the fish base consists of two radial folds against a diagonal reference crease on each of two opposite corners the waterbomb base consists of two perpendicular valley folds down the diagonals of the square and two perpendicular mountain folds down the center of the square the open double sink is used in many box-pleated models the spread squash is used in the eyes of engel 's octopus , in marie 's rose , and in some other intermediate and complex models ( if this is tried with a non-conical point , such as the waterbomb base itself , eventually the fold will terminate in a spread squash

later books began to devise a system of showing precisely how a model was folded these ranged from an unwieldy set of symbols to a photograph or sketch of each step attempting to show the motion of a fold in the 1950s and '60s , akira yoshizawa proposed a system of diagramming he introduced its diagramming notation in his first published monograph , atarashi origami geijutsu ( new origami art ) in 1954 the yoshizawaâ€“randlett system was first described in samuel randlett 's art of origami in 1961 a dotted line shows a previous fold that 's hidden behind other paper , or sometimes shows a fold that 's not yet made the pleat folds and reverse folds are often done with the two creases at an angle reverse folds of a corner are typically used to produce feet or birds heads the sink fold is considered an intermediary to high skill a squash fold starts with a flap with at least two layers ( for example , one flap of a waterbomb base ) open the flap and refold downward to make two adjacent flaps make two radial folds from the open point , so that the open edges lie along the reference crease make another fold across the top connecting the ends of the creases to create a triangle of creases in origami , there is a series of several bases that many models are created with a blintz base is made by folding the corners of a square into the center the resulting square can then be used as the starting point for any base or blintzed again the kite base is merely two valley folds that bring two adjacent edges of the square together to lie on the square 's diagonal ) after forming the bird base , either partially unfold the paper , and/or '' stretch '' two opposite corners of the bird base the open double sink is used in many box-pleated models the closed unsink inverts a closed sink without completely opening out the affected paper the following are books that happen to have detailed explanations of these techniques , and how the techniques are related to each other : robert j happyfolding.com site featuring instructional origami videos , an origami dictionary , etc .

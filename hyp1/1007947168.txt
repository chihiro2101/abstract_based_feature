the concept of diagramming originated in the 1797 book “ senbazuru orikata ” , the first origami book ever published in the 1950s and '60s , akira yoshizawa proposed a system of diagramming he introduced its diagramming notation in his first published monograph , atarashi origami geijutsu ( new origami art ) in 1954 the yoshizawa–randlett system was first described in samuel randlett 's art of origami in 1961 lines show various types of edges : a thick line shows the edge of the paper a dashed line shows a valley fold a dashed and dotted line shows a mountain fold ( there may be one or two dots per dash depending on the author ) the paper is folded behind itself , this is normally done by turning the paper over , folding a valley fold and then turning the paper back over again a squash fold starts with a flap with at least two layers ( for example , one flap of a waterbomb base ) open the flap and refold downward to make two adjacent flaps a rabbit ear fold starts with a reference crease down a diagonal fold two radial folds from opposite corners along the same side of the reference crease ; the resulting flap should be folded downwards so that the previous edges are aligned make two radial folds from the open point , so that the open edges lie along the reference crease a petal fold is equivalent to two side-by-side rabbit ears , which are connected along the reference crease squash-fold.svg squash fold applied to one flap of a waterbomb base rabbit-ear-fold.svg rabbit ear fold petal-fold.svg petal fold on one half of a preliminary fold in general , '' base '' refers to any folded paper that immediately precedes final folding and shaping of the model-to-be the kite base is merely two valley folds that bring two adjacent edges of the square together to lie on the square 's diagonal the fish base consists of two radial folds against a diagonal reference crease on each of two opposite corners the waterbomb base consists of two perpendicular valley folds down the diagonals of the square and two perpendicular mountain folds down the center of the square ) after forming the bird base , either partially unfold the paper , and/or '' stretch '' two opposite corners of the bird base the stretched bird base is used in lang 's bald eagle , greenberg 's eeyore , and some other high-intermediate and complex models the open sink usually involves opening out the paper , and reversing creases to make a waterbomb base in the middle of the model the spread squash is used in the eyes of engel 's octopus , in marie 's rose , and in some other intermediate and complex models

the diagrams in this book were very unclear , and often only showed the end result of the folding process , leaving the folder unsure how the model was created these ranged from an unwieldy set of symbols to a photograph or sketch of each step attempting to show the motion of a fold it was then accepted as the default throughout the international origami community , and is still in general use today lines show various types of edges : a thick line shows the edge of the paper a dashed line shows a valley fold a thin line shows where a previous fold has creased the paper a dotted line shows a previous fold that 's hidden behind other paper , or sometimes shows a fold that 's not yet made the version shown here is called an open sink and there is another version called a closed sink which generates a triangular pocket with no flaps showing in simple cases the model can be partly unfolded and then folded with the sink in place a squash fold starts with a flap with at least two layers ( for example , one flap of a waterbomb base ) make a radial fold from the closed point down the center of this flap open the flap and refold downward to make two adjacent flaps fold two radial folds from opposite corners along the same side of the reference crease ; the resulting flap should be folded downwards so that the previous edges are aligned a petal fold starts with two connected flaps , each of which has at least two layers ( for example , two flaps of a preliminary base ) make two radial folds from the open point , so that the open edges lie along the reference crease unfold these two radial folds fold one layer of the open point upward and flatten it using the existing creases a petal fold is equivalent to two side-by-side rabbit ears , which are connected along the reference crease the resulting square can then be used as the starting point for any base or blintzed again the fish base consists of two radial folds against a diagonal reference crease on each of two opposite corners ) after forming the bird base , either partially unfold the paper , and/or '' stretch '' two opposite corners of the bird base ( if this is tried with a non-conical point , such as the waterbomb base itself , eventually the fold will terminate in a spread squash

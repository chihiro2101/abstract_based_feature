the identification of self-esteem as a distinct psychological construct has its origins in the work of philosopher , psychologist , geologist , and anthropologist william james ( 1892 ) james identified multiple dimensions of the self , with two levels of hierarchy : processes of knowing ( called the ' i-self ' ) and the resulting knowledge about the self ( the 'me-self ' ) the observation about the self and storage of those observations by the i-self creates three types of knowledge , which collectively account for the me-self , according to james the social self comes closest to self-esteem , comprising all characteristics recognized by others this view of self-esteem as the collection of an individual 's attitudes toward oneself remains today in the mid-1960s , social psychologist morris rosenberg defined self-esteem as a feeling of self-worth and developed the rosenberg self-esteem scale ( rses ) , which became the most-widely used scale to measure self-esteem in the social sciences as a consequence , clinical trials on self-esteem were overlooked , since behaviorists considered the idea less liable to rigorous measurement in the mid-20th century , the rise of phenomenology and humanistic psychology led to renewed interest in self-esteem self-esteem then took a central role in personal self-actualization and in the treatment of psychic disorders the core self-evaluations approach included self-esteem as one of four dimensions that comprise one 's fundamental appraisal of oneself - along with locus of control , neuroticism , and self-efficacy the concept of core self-evaluations as first examined by judge , locke , and durham ( 1997 ) , has since proven to have the ability to predict job satisfaction and job performance self-esteem may be essential to self-evaluation the importance of self-esteem gained endorsement from some government and non-government groups starting around the 1970s , such that one can speak of a self-esteem movement the underlying idea of the movement was that low self-esteem was the root of problems for individuals , making it the root of societal problems and dysfunctions self-esteem was believed to be a cultural phenomenon of western society since low self-esteem was not found in collectivism countries such as japan concern about low self-esteem and its many presumed negative consequences led california assemblyman john vasconcellos to work to set up and fund the task force on self-esteem and personal and social responsibility in california in 1986 he compared increasing self-esteem to giving out a vaccine for a disease : it could help protect people from being overwhelmed by life 's challenges the task force set up committees in many california counties and formed a committee of scholars to review the available literature on self-esteem however , the authors of the paper that summarized the review of the literature still believe that self-esteem is an independent variable that affects major social problems american psychologist abraham maslow included self-esteem in his hierarchy of human needs respect from others was believed to be more fragile and easily lost than inner self-esteem according to maslow , without the fulfillment of the self-esteem need , individuals will be driven to seek it and unable to grow and obtain self-actualization modern theories of self-esteem explore the reasons humans are motivated to maintain a high regard for themselves sociometer theory maintains that self-esteem evolved to check one 's level of status and acceptance in ones ' social group this is why rogers believed in the importance of giving unconditional acceptance to a client and when this was done it could improve the client 's self-esteem indeed , the concept of self-esteem is approached since then in humanistic psychology as an inalienable right for every person , summarized in the following sentence : self-esteem is typically assessed using self-report inventories these rely on indirect measures of cognitive processing thought to be linked to implicit self-esteem , including the name letter task on the nature of implicit self-esteem : the case of the name letter effect ) , motivated social perception : the ontario symposium ( pp when used to assess implicit self-esteem , psychologists feature self-relevant stimuli to the participant and then measure how quickly a person identifies positive or negative stimuli experiences in a person 's life are a major source of how self-esteem develops experiences that contribute to low self-esteem include being harshly criticized , being physically , sexually or emotionally abused , being ignored , ridiculed or teased or being expected to be '' perfect '' all the time during school-aged years , academic achievement is a significant contributor to self-esteem development social experiences are another important contributor to self-esteem using social comparisons , children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities these comparisons play an important role in shaping the child 's self-esteem and influence the positive or negative feelings they have about themselves successful relationships among friends are very important to the development of high self-esteem for children social acceptance brings about confidence and produces high self-esteem , whereas rejection from peers and loneliness brings about self-doubts and produces low self-esteem adolescence shows an increase in self-esteem that continues to increase in young adulthood and middle age reasons for the variability could be because of differences in health , cognitive ability , and socioeconomic status in old age no differences have been found between males and females in their development of self-esteem these predictors have shown us that self-esteem has trait-like qualities by remaining stable over time like personality and intelligence hispanic adolescents have a slightly lower self-esteem than their black and white peers , but then slightly higher levels by age 30 in a survey on technology 60 % of people using social media reported that it has impacted their self-esteem in a negative way . real self , ideal self , and dreaded self there are three levels of self-evaluation development in relation to the real self , ideal self , and the dreaded self moral judgment stages : individuals describe their real , ideal , and dreaded selves with stereotypical labels , such as '' nice '' or '' bad '' both explicit self-esteem and implicit self-esteem are subtypes of self-esteem proper under this assumption , some american groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students high self-esteem has a high correlation to self-reported happiness ; whether this is a causal relationship has not been established additionally , self-esteem has been found to be related to forgiveness in close relationships , in that people with high self-esteem will be more forgiving than people with low self-esteem impact publishers although acknowledging the human propensity and tendency to ego rating as innate , he has critiqued the philosophy of self-esteem as unrealistic , illogical and self- and socially destructive â€“ often doing more harm than good for persons with low self-esteem , any positive stimulus will temporarily raise self-esteem

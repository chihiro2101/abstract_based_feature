the concept of self-esteem has its origins in the 18th century , first expressed in the writings of david hume the observation about the self and storage of those observations by the i-self creates three types of knowledge , which collectively account for the me-self , according to james the social self comes closest to self-esteem , comprising all characteristics recognized by others as a consequence , clinical trials on self-esteem were overlooked , since behaviorists considered the idea less liable to rigorous measurement self-esteem then took a central role in personal self-actualization and in the treatment of psychic disorders in 1992 the political scientist francis fukuyama associated self-esteem with what plato called thumos â€“ the '' spiritedness '' part of the platonic soul self-esteem may be essential to self-evaluation this movement can be used as an example of promising evidence that psychological research can have an effect on forming public policy the underlying idea of the movement was that low self-esteem was the root of problems for individuals , making it the root of societal problems and dysfunctions self-esteem was believed to be a cultural phenomenon of western society since low self-esteem was not found in collectivism countries such as japan concern about low self-esteem and its many presumed negative consequences led california assemblyman john vasconcellos to work to set up and fund the task force on self-esteem and personal and social responsibility in california in 1986 he compared increasing self-esteem to giving out a vaccine for a disease : it could help protect people from being overwhelmed by life 's challenges many early theories suggested that self-esteem is a basic human need or motivation american psychologist abraham maslow included self-esteem in his hierarchy of human needs respect from others was believed to be more fragile and easily lost than inner self-esteem according to maslow , without the fulfillment of the self-esteem need , individuals will be driven to seek it and unable to grow and obtain self-actualization sociometer theory maintains that self-esteem evolved to check one 's level of status and acceptance in ones ' social group according to terror management theory , self-esteem serves a protective function and reduces anxiety about life and death this is why rogers believed in the importance of giving unconditional acceptance to a client and when this was done it could improve the client 's self-esteem these rely on indirect measures of cognitive processing thought to be linked to implicit self-esteem , including the name letter task on the nature of implicit self-esteem : the case of the name letter effect when used to assess implicit self-esteem , psychologists feature self-relevant stimuli to the participant and then measure how quickly a person identifies positive or negative stimuli for example , if a woman was given the self-relevant stimuli of female and mother , psychologists would measure how quickly she identified the negative word , evil , or the positive word , kind in the early years of a child 's life , parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered the main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have unconditional love from parents helps a child develop a stable sense of being cared for and respected these feelings translate into later effects on self-esteem as the child grows older however , students can also experience low self- esteem while in school for example , they may not have academic achievements , or they live in a troubled environment outside of school social experiences are another important contributor to self-esteem using social comparisons , children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities these comparisons play an important role in shaping the child 's self-esteem and influence the positive or negative feelings they have about themselves adolescents make appraisals of themselves based on their relationships with close friends successful relationships among friends are very important to the development of high self-esteem for children social acceptance brings about confidence and produces high self-esteem , whereas rejection from peers and loneliness brings about self-doubts and produces low self-esteem a decrease is seen from middle age to old age with varying findings on whether it is a small or large decrease in terms of personality , emotionally stable , extroverted , and conscientious individuals experience higher self-esteem these predictors have shown us that self-esteem has trait-like qualities by remaining stable over time like personality and intelligence hispanic adolescents have a slightly lower self-esteem than their black and white peers , but then slightly higher levels by age 30 african americans have a sharper increase in self-esteem in adolescence and young adulthood compared to whites shame can be a contributor to those with problems of low self-esteem a poor performance leads to higher responses of psychological states that indicate a threat to the social self namely a decrease in social self-esteem and an increase in shame . real self , ideal self , and dreaded self there are three levels of self-evaluation development in relation to the real self , ideal self , and the dreaded self the dreaded self is often described as being unsuccessful or as having bad habits the dreaded self is often described as having failed to meet social expectations or as self-centered descriptions of the dreaded self focus on a failure to live up to one 's ideals or role expectations often because of real world problems this development brings with it increasingly complicated and encompassing moral demands this feeling will moderately affect one 's self-esteem with an even larger effect seen when individuals believe they are becoming their dreaded selves both explicit self-esteem and implicit self-esteem are subtypes of self-esteem proper under this assumption , some american groups created programs which aimed to increase the self-esteem of students the american psychologist albert ellis criticized on numerous occasions the concept of self-esteem as essentially self-defeating and ultimately destructive people with high self-esteem are more willing to act on their beliefs , to stand up for what they believe in , to approach others , to risk new undertakings for persons with low self-esteem , any positive stimulus will temporarily raise self-esteem '' narcissism can thus be seen as a symptom of fundamentally low self-esteem , that is , lack of love towards oneself , but often accompanied by '' an immense increase in self-esteem '' based on '' the defense mechanism of denial by overcompensation

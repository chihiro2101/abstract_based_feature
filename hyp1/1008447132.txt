the concept of self-esteem has its origins in the 18th century , first expressed in the writings of david hume the scottish enlightenment thinker , shows the idea that it is important to value and think well of yourself because it serves as a motivational function that enables people to explore their full potential the identification of self-esteem as a distinct psychological construct has its origins in the work of philosopher , psychologist , geologist , and anthropologist william james ( 1892 ) these are the material self , social self , and spiritual self the social self comes closest to self-esteem , comprising all characteristics recognized by others the material self consists of representations of the body and possessions and the spiritual self of descriptive representations and evaluative dispositions regarding the self in the mid-1960s , social psychologist morris rosenberg defined self-esteem as a feeling of self-worth and developed the rosenberg self-esteem scale ( rses ) , which became the most-widely used scale to measure self-esteem in the social sciences psychologists started to consider the relationship between psychotherapy and the personal satisfaction of persons with high self-esteem as useful to the field in 1992 the political scientist francis fukuyama associated self-esteem with what plato called thumos – the '' spiritedness '' part of the platonic soul the concept of core self-evaluations as first examined by judge , locke , and durham ( 1997 ) , has since proven to have the ability to predict job satisfaction and job performance concern about low self-esteem and its many presumed negative consequences led california assemblyman john vasconcellos to work to set up and fund the task force on self-esteem and personal and social responsibility in california in 1986 he compared increasing self-esteem to giving out a vaccine for a disease : it could help protect people from being overwhelmed by life 's challenges the task force set up committees in many california counties and formed a committee of scholars to review the available literature on self-esteem this committee found very small associations between low self-esteem and its assumed consequences , ultimately showing that low self-esteem is not the root of all societal problems and not as important as the committee had originally thought the task force disbanded in 1995 , and the national council for self-esteem and later the national association for self-esteem ( nase ) was established , taking on the task force 's mission respect from others was believed to be more fragile and easily lost than inner self-esteem according to maslow , without the fulfillment of the self-esteem need , individuals will be driven to seek it and unable to grow and obtain self-actualization maslow also states that the healthiest expression of self-esteem '' is the one which manifests in the respect we deserve for others , more than renown , fame , and flattery '' modern theories of self-esteem explore the reasons humans are motivated to maintain a high regard for themselves sociometer theory maintains that self-esteem evolved to check one 's level of status and acceptance in ones ' social group carl rogers ( 1902–1987 ) , an advocate of humanistic psychology , theorized the origin of many people 's problems to be that they despise themselves and consider themselves worthless and incapable of being loved this is why rogers believed in the importance of giving unconditional acceptance to a client and when this was done it could improve the client 's self-esteem indeed , the concept of self-esteem is approached since then in humanistic psychology as an inalienable right for every person , summarized in the following sentence : if those answers reveal some inner shame , it considers them to be prone to social deviance implicit measures of self-esteem began to be used in the 1980s when used to assess implicit self-esteem , psychologists feature self-relevant stimuli to the participant and then measure how quickly a person identifies positive or negative stimuli in the early years of a child 's life , parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered the main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have childhood experiences that contribute to healthy self-esteem include being listened to , being spoken to respectfully , receiving appropriate attention and affection and having accomplishments recognized and mistakes or failures acknowledged and accepted as children go through adolescence , peer influence becomes much more important in terms of personality , emotionally stable , extroverted , and conscientious individuals experience higher self-esteem hispanic adolescents have a slightly lower self-esteem than their black and white peers , but then slightly higher levels by age 30 shame can be a contributor to those with problems of low self-esteem a poor performance leads to higher responses of psychological states that indicate a threat to the social self namely a decrease in social self-esteem and an increase in shame . real self , ideal self , and dreaded self there are three levels of self-evaluation development in relation to the real self , ideal self , and the dreaded self the real , ideal , and dreaded selves develop in children in a sequential pattern on cognitive levels moral judgment stages : individuals describe their real , ideal , and dreaded selves with stereotypical labels , such as '' nice '' or '' bad '' ego development stages : individuals describe their ideal and real selves in terms of traits that are based on attitudes as well as actions this level is where individuals ' self-esteems can suffer because they do not feel as though they are living up to certain expectations this feeling will moderately affect one 's self-esteem with an even larger effect seen when individuals believe they are becoming their dreaded selves do not lose time worrying excessively about what happened in the past , nor about what could happen in the future consider themselves equal in dignity to others , rather than inferior or superior , while accepting differences in certain talents , personal prestige or financial standing admit and accept different internal feelings and drives , either positive or negative , revealing those drives to others only when they choose can work toward finding solutions and voice discontent without belittling themselves or others when challenges arise there is a need for constant positive feedback from others for these individuals to maintain their feelings of self-worth the necessity of repeated praise can be associated with boastful , arrogant behavior or sometimes even aggressive and hostile feelings toward anyone who questions the individual 's self-worth , an example of threatened egotism it contrasts with explicit self-esteem , which entails more conscious and reflective self-evaluation '' barbara krahe , the social psychology of aggression ( psychology press , 2013 ) , 75 there is only a moderate correlation between narcissism and self-esteem ; that is to say that an individual can have high self-esteem but low narcissism or can be a conceited , obnoxious person and score high self-esteem and high narcissism threatened egotism is characterized as a response to criticism that threatens the ego of narcissists ; they often react in a hostile and aggressive manner low self-esteem can result from various factors , including genetic factors , physical appearance or weight , mental health issues , socioeconomic status , significant emotional experiences , social stigma , peer pressure or bullying people with strong self-esteem have a positive self-image and enough strength so that anti-feats do not subdue their self-esteem josé-vicente bonet claims that the importance of self-esteem is obvious as a lack of self-esteem is , he says , not a loss of esteem from others , but self-rejection for persons with low self-esteem , any positive stimulus will temporarily raise self-esteem

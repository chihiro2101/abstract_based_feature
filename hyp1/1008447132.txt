the concept of self-esteem has its origins in the 18th century , first expressed in the writings of david hume the identification of self-esteem as a distinct psychological construct has its origins in the work of philosopher , psychologist , geologist , and anthropologist william james ( 1892 ) these are the material self , social self , and spiritual self the social self comes closest to self-esteem , comprising all characteristics recognized by others the material self consists of representations of the body and possessions and the spiritual self of descriptive representations and evaluative dispositions regarding the self this view of self-esteem as the collection of an individual 's attitudes toward oneself remains today as a consequence , clinical trials on self-esteem were overlooked , since behaviorists considered the idea less liable to rigorous measurement in the mid-20th century , the rise of phenomenology and humanistic psychology led to renewed interest in self-esteem self-esteem then took a central role in personal self-actualization and in the treatment of psychic disorders psychologists started to consider the relationship between psychotherapy and the personal satisfaction of persons with high self-esteem as useful to the field this led to new elements being introduced to the concept of self-esteem , including the reasons why people tend to feel less worthy and why people become discouraged or unable to meet challenges by themselves in 1992 the political scientist francis fukuyama associated self-esteem with what plato called thumos â€“ the '' spiritedness '' part of the platonic soul the core self-evaluations approach included self-esteem as one of four dimensions that comprise one 's fundamental appraisal of oneself - along with locus of control , neuroticism , and self-efficacy the importance of self-esteem gained endorsement from some government and non-government groups starting around the 1970s , such that one can speak of a self-esteem movement this movement can be used as an example of promising evidence that psychological research can have an effect on forming public policy self-esteem was believed to be a cultural phenomenon of western society since low self-esteem was not found in collectivism countries such as japan the task force set up committees in many california counties and formed a committee of scholars to review the available literature on self-esteem this committee found very small associations between low self-esteem and its assumed consequences , ultimately showing that low self-esteem is not the root of all societal problems and not as important as the committee had originally thought many early theories suggested that self-esteem is a basic human need or motivation he described two different forms of '' esteem '' : the need for respect from others in the form of recognition , success , and admiration , and the need for self-respect in the form of self-love , self-confidence , skill , or aptitude respect from others was believed to be more fragile and easily lost than inner self-esteem modern theories of self-esteem explore the reasons humans are motivated to maintain a high regard for themselves indeed , the concept of self-esteem is approached since then in humanistic psychology as an inalienable right for every person , summarized in the following sentence : self-esteem is typically assessed using self-report inventories one of the most widely used instruments , the rosenberg self-esteem scale ( rses ) is a 10-item self-esteem scale score that requires participants to indicate their level of agreement with a series of statements about themselves an alternative measure , the coopersmith inventory uses a 50-question battery over a variety of topics and asks subjects whether they rate someone as similar or dissimilar to themselves these rely on indirect measures of cognitive processing thought to be linked to implicit self-esteem , including the name letter task when used to assess implicit self-esteem , psychologists feature self-relevant stimuli to the participant and then measure how quickly a person identifies positive or negative stimuli for example , if a woman was given the self-relevant stimuli of female and mother , psychologists would measure how quickly she identified the negative word , evil , or the positive word , kind experiences in a person 's life are a major source of how self-esteem develops these feelings translate into later effects on self-esteem as the child grows older childhood experiences that contribute to healthy self-esteem include being listened to , being spoken to respectfully , receiving appropriate attention and affection and having accomplishments recognized and mistakes or failures acknowledged and accepted consistently achieving success or consistently failing will have a strong effect on students ' individual self-esteem however , students can also experience low self- esteem while in school for example , they may not have academic achievements , or they live in a troubled environment outside of school using social comparisons , children assess whether they did better or worse than classmates in different activities these comparisons play an important role in shaping the child 's self-esteem and influence the positive or negative feelings they have about themselves successful relationships among friends are very important to the development of high self-esteem for children high levels of mastery , low risk taking , and better health are ways to predict higher self-esteem hispanic adolescents have a slightly lower self-esteem than their black and white peers , but then slightly higher levels by age 30 however , during old age , they experience a more rapid decline in self-esteem a poor performance leads to higher responses of psychological states that indicate a threat to the social self namely a decrease in social self-esteem and an increase in shame there are three levels of self-evaluation development in relation to the real self , ideal self , and the dreaded self moral judgment stages : individuals describe their real , ideal , and dreaded selves with stereotypical labels , such as '' nice '' or '' bad '' the dreaded self is often described as being unsuccessful or as having bad habits ego development stages : individuals describe their ideal and real selves in terms of traits that are based on attitudes as well as actions self-understanding stages : individuals describe their ideal and real selves as having unified identities or characters this level is where individuals ' self-esteems can suffer because they do not feel as though they are living up to certain expectations fully trust in their capacity to solve problems , not hesitating after failures and difficulties both explicit self-esteem and implicit self-esteem are subtypes of self-esteem proper however , no type of self-esteem is indestructible , and due to certain situations or circumstances in life , one can fall from this level into any other state of self-esteem high self-esteem has a high correlation to self-reported happiness ; whether this is a causal relationship has not been established people with high self-esteem are more willing to act on their beliefs , to stand up for what they believe in , to approach others , to risk new undertakings such attempts to raise one 's self-esteem by positive stimulus produce a '' boom or bust '' pattern

your username is a nickname that will identify your account and thereby all of your contributions to wikipedia it can be your real name , if you so choose , but you should be aware of real names in editing under your real name by default , your username appears in your signature on posts to discussion pages ; for details on signatures and how to customize them , see wikipedia : signatures however , you should read the section on using your real name as your username you specify your username when creating an account , and subsequently use it ( together with your secret password ) to log in to that account you or any other editor may also create a user talk page , titled '' user talk : xxxx '' , that people can use to contact you the software will not allow you to register with a username that is already in use , or one that appears too similar to one that is already in use special : centralauth can be used to check whether a username is already taken or not ; if it is not listed there you can easily register it , unless it is too similar to an existing one this page describes certain types of usernames that are specifically disallowed , primarily because they can be considered offensive , misleading , or promotional , or imply that the account does not belong to an individual use common sense in applying these rules ( such as a word that may seem offensive in one context may have another , more benign meaning in another context ) the following types of username are not permitted because they may be misleading in a way that disrupts the project : usernames that impersonate other people ( see and below ) usernames that give the impression that the account has permissions which it does not have ; e.g usernames that appear similar to naming conventions used by community administrative processes , such as those starting with vanished user ( see wikipedia : courtesy vanishing ) the following types of usernames are not permitted because they are disruptive or offensive : usernames that are likely to offend other contributors , making harmonious editing difficult or impossible ; e.g note that usernames that are inappropriate in another language , or that represent an inappropriate name with misspellings and substitutions , or do so indirectly or by implication , are still considered inappropriate the following types of usernames are not permitted because they are considered promotional : usernames that unambiguously represent the name of a company , group , institution or product ( e.g ( usernames which represent the subject of a biographical article are not considered promotional ; see email addresses and urls ( such as '' alice example.com '' and '' example.com '' ) that promote a commercial web page and do n't simply identify a person if there is evidence that the user would continue to edit inappropriately under a new username , the blocking administrator should enable the '' autoblock '' and '' prevent account creation '' features because wikipedia 's policy is that usernames should not be shared between more than one individual , the following types of usernames are not permitted because they imply shared use : usernames that are simply names of companies or groups are not permitted ( these also fall under above ) however , usernames are acceptable if they contain a company or group name but are clearly intended to denote an individual person , such as '' mark at widgetsusa '' , '' jack smith at the xy foundation '' , '' widgetfan87 '' , etc this is often the case with confusing or extremely lengthy usernames , which are highly discouraged but which are not so inappropriate on their own as to require action an editor with a confusing username or signature may be blocked sooner than usual for other inappropriate behavior such as disruption or vandalism , if their confusing username contributes to the disruption if the user with a bad username is breaching other policies , such as those against spam or wp : vand , follow up using those policies rather than reporting the username generally , editors whose usernames are a technical or borderline violation of the username policy should be given an opportunity to discuss the username and how they may register a new username users may use their stage name , pen name , or other nickname as their username , provided that it uniquely identifies a single person usernames that are very similar to existing ones can not be registered normallybut if you do want to use one , you may request its creation at wikipedia : request an account the program that checks for similarity is a bit over-sensitiveif the username is different enough as to prevent other people from confusing the two users , the request should be approved any user account should represent an individual and not a group ( and an individual should normally only have one user account ; see next section ) sharing an account – or the password to an account – with others is not permitted , and evidence of doing so will result in the user being required to stop the practice and change their password , or in sanctions ( up to and including the account being blocked ) , depending on circumstances usernames can be changed by global renamers ; requests should be made at wikipedia : changing username username changes are listed in the user rename log and the global rename log

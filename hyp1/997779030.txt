your username is a nickname that will identify your account and thereby all of your contributions to wikipedia it can be your real name , if you so choose , but you should be aware of real names in editing under your real name by default , your username appears in your signature on posts to discussion pages ; for details on signatures and how to customize them , see wikipedia : signatures however , you should read the section on using your real name as your username you specify your username when creating an account , and subsequently use it ( together with your secret password ) to log in to that account once you have an account , you may create a user page , titled '' user : xxxx '' ( where '' xxxx '' is your username ) , to provide relevant information about yourself to other wikipedians you or any other editor may also create a user talk page , titled '' user talk : xxxx '' , that people can use to contact you the software will not allow you to register with a username that is already in use , or one that appears too similar to one that is already in use this page describes certain types of usernames that are specifically disallowed , primarily because they can be considered offensive , misleading , or promotional , or imply that the account does not belong to an individual use common sense in applying these rules ( such as a word that may seem offensive in one context may have another , more benign meaning in another context ) usernames that could be easily misunderstood to refer to a '' bot '' ( which is used to identify bot accounts ) or a '' script '' ( which alludes to automated editing processes ) , unless the account is of that type usernames including phrases such as '' wikipedia '' , '' wikimedia '' , '' wiktionary '' , '' ( wmf ) '' , or similar if they give the incorrect impression that the account may be officially affiliated with the wikimedia foundation or one of its projects usernames that resemble ip addresses ( as these are expected to designate non-logged-in users ) , timestamps or other names which would be confusing within the wikipedia signature format the following types of usernames are not permitted because they are disruptive or offensive : usernames that are likely to offend other contributors , making harmonious editing difficult or impossible ; e.g usernames that otherwise show a clear intent to disrupt wikipedia note that usernames that are inappropriate in another language , or that represent an inappropriate name with misspellings and substitutions , or do so indirectly or by implication , are still considered inappropriate usernames violating the blp policy a user who both adopts a promotional username and also engages in inappropriately promotional behaviors in articles about the company , group , or product , can be blocked in such cases , administrators should examine the user 's edits to decide whether or not to allow them to create a new username because wikipedia 's policy is that usernames should not be shared between more than one individual , the following types of usernames are not permitted because they imply shared use : usernames that are simply names of companies or groups are not permitted ( these also fall under above ) however , usernames are acceptable if they contain a company or group name but are clearly intended to denote an individual person , such as '' mark at widgetsusa '' , '' jack smith at the xy foundation '' , '' widgetfan87 '' , etc remember that promotional editing is not permitted regardless of username if you choose to edit articles that are in any way related to your company or group , you will need to carefully follow wikipedia 's advice on editing with a conflict of interest an editor with a confusing username or signature may be blocked sooner than usual for other inappropriate behavior such as disruption or vandalism , if their confusing username contributes to the disruption note that this restriction does not apply to signatures , which are governed by wikipedia : signatures also , except in extreme cases , it is probably not worth taking action unless the user has made at least one recent edit while it is possible to rename your account later ( see changing your username below ) , a record of your previous username remains permanently if a name is used that implies that the user is ( or is related to ) a specific , identifiable person , the account may sometimes be blocked as a precaution against damaging impersonation , until proof of identity is provided any user account should represent an individual and not a group ( and an individual should normally only have one user account ; see next section ) because policies apply to individuals , not accounts , blocked or banned users must not use sock puppets to circumvent a block ; doing so will result in an extension of the block or ban once a username has been changed , existing contributions will be listed under the new name in page histories , diffs , logs , and user contributions

your username is a nickname that will identify your account and thereby all of your contributions to wikipedia it can be your real name , if you so choose , but you should be aware of real names in editing under your real name by default , your username appears in your signature on posts to discussion pages ; for details on signatures and how to customize them , see wikipedia : signatures however , you should read the section on using your real name as your username you specify your username when creating an account , and subsequently use it ( together with your secret password ) to log in to that account once you have an account , you may create a user page , titled '' user : xxxx '' ( where '' xxxx '' is your username ) , to provide relevant information about yourself to other wikipedians you or any other editor may also create a user talk page , titled '' user talk : xxxx '' , that people can use to contact you the software will not allow you to register with a username that is already in use , or one that appears too similar to one that is already in use special : centralauth can be used to check whether a username is already taken or not ; if it is not listed there you can easily register it , unless it is too similar to an existing one this page describes certain types of usernames that are specifically disallowed , primarily because they can be considered offensive , misleading , or promotional , or imply that the account does not belong to an individual this section lists the types of usernames that are considered inappropriate the following types of username are not permitted because they may be misleading in a way that disrupts the project : usernames that impersonate other people ( see and below ) usernames that give the impression that the account has permissions which it does not have ; e.g usernames that could be easily misunderstood to refer to a '' bot '' ( which is used to identify bot accounts ) or a '' script '' ( which alludes to automated editing processes ) , unless the account is of that type note that usernames that are inappropriate in another language , or that represent an inappropriate name with misspellings and substitutions , or do so indirectly or by implication , are still considered inappropriate in such cases , administrators should examine the user 's edits to decide whether or not to allow them to create a new username if there is evidence that the user would continue to edit inappropriately under a new username , the blocking administrator should enable the '' autoblock '' and '' prevent account creation '' features otherwise , the user should be offered the opportunity to create a new account ( before blocking , disagreements as to whether a particular username is acceptable should be discussed at wp : requests for comment/usernames because wikipedia 's policy is that usernames should not be shared between more than one individual , the following types of usernames are not permitted because they imply shared use : usernames that are simply names of companies or groups are not permitted ( these also fall under above ) usernames that are names of posts within organizations , such as '' secretary of the xy foundation '' , are not permitted , as such a post may be held by different persons at different times the wikipedia : conflict of interest advises all users to exercise caution if editing articles about businesses , organizations , products , or other subjects that they are closely connected to this is often the case with confusing or extremely lengthy usernames , which are highly discouraged but which are not so inappropriate on their own as to require action some usernames that appear to be in breach of this policy have been allowed to stand by consensus because they were created before a change in the policy that would now prohibit such names ( see grandfather clause ) while it is possible to rename your account later ( see changing your username below ) , a record of your previous username remains permanently the best way will vary , but could be by using a mail address on a domain name that belongs to you or sending out a tweet using a verified account usernames that are very similar to existing ones can not be registered normallybut if you do want to use one , you may request its creation at wikipedia : request an account sharing an account – or the password to an account – with others is not permitted , and evidence of doing so will result in the user being required to stop the practice and change their password , or in sanctions ( up to and including the account being blocked ) , depending on circumstances it is recommended that multiple accounts be identified as such on their user pages ; templates such as or one of a selection of user boxes may be used for this purpose once a username has been changed , existing contributions will be listed under the new name in page histories , diffs , logs , and user contributions signatures on discussion pages will continue to use the old name ; while these can be changed manually , it is not recommended unless a contributor wishes to remove as much information as possible about their former name for privacy reasons

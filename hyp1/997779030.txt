your username is a nickname that will identify your account and thereby all of your contributions to wikipedia it can be your real name , if you so choose , but you should be aware of real names in editing under your real name by default , your username appears in your signature on posts to discussion pages ; for details on signatures and how to customize them , see wikipedia : signatures franz schr√∂der '' , then your doctorate will be evident on history pages and , unless you change your signature , on all posts to talk pages once you have an account , you may create a user page , titled '' user : xxxx '' ( where '' xxxx '' is your username ) , to provide relevant information about yourself to other wikipedians you or any other editor may also create a user talk page , titled '' user talk : xxxx '' , that people can use to contact you the software will not allow you to register with a username that is already in use , or one that appears too similar to one that is already in use special : centralauth can be used to check whether a username is already taken or not ; if it is not listed there you can easily register it , unless it is too similar to an existing one with a similar username , you may still be able to obtain it under certain circumstances : see below a controversial name may give a bad impression to other users , and avoiding this is in your own interest this page describes certain types of usernames that are specifically disallowed , primarily because they can be considered offensive , misleading , or promotional , or imply that the account does not belong to an individual the following types of username are not permitted because they may be misleading in a way that disrupts the project : usernames that impersonate other people ( see and below ) usernames that give the impression that the account has permissions which it does not have ; e.g usernames that resemble ip addresses ( as these are expected to designate non-logged-in users ) , timestamps or other names which would be confusing within the wikipedia signature format the following types of usernames are not permitted because they are disruptive or offensive : usernames that are likely to offend other contributors , making harmonious editing difficult or impossible ; e.g note that usernames that are inappropriate in another language , or that represent an inappropriate name with misspellings and substitutions , or do so indirectly or by implication , are still considered inappropriate however usernames that contain such names are sometimes permissible ; see below ( usernames which represent the subject of a biographical article are not considered promotional ; see email addresses and urls ( such as '' alice example.com '' and '' example.com '' ) that promote a commercial web page and do n't simply identify a person ) are sometimes acceptable , such as when the purpose is simply to identify the user as a person , they are inappropriate if they promote a commercial web page a user who both adopts a promotional username and also engages in inappropriately promotional behaviors in articles about the company , group , or product , can be blocked if there is evidence that the user would continue to edit inappropriately under a new username , the blocking administrator should enable the '' autoblock '' and '' prevent account creation '' features otherwise , the user should be offered the opportunity to create a new account because wikipedia 's policy is that usernames should not be shared between more than one individual , the following types of usernames are not permitted because they imply shared use : usernames that are simply names of companies or groups are not permitted ( these also fall under above ) personal usernames that imply shared access , such as '' jack and jill '' , are not permitted usernames that are names of posts within organizations , such as '' secretary of the xy foundation '' , are not permitted , as such a post may be held by different persons at different times also , except in extreme cases , it is probably not worth taking action unless the user has made at least one recent edit generally , editors whose usernames are a technical or borderline violation of the username policy should be given an opportunity to discuss the username and how they may register a new username users may use their stage name , pen name , or other nickname as their username , provided that it uniquely identifies a single person if your username is similar to that of another contributor or an article , you may wish to provide some form of disambiguation , such as by adding to the top of your user page any user account should represent an individual and not a group ( and an individual should normally only have one user account ; see next section ) once a username has been changed , existing contributions will be listed under the new name in page histories , diffs , logs , and user contributions

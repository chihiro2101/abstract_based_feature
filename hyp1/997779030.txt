your username is a nickname that will identify your account and thereby all of your contributions to wikipedia by default , your username appears in your signature on posts to discussion pages ; for details on signatures and how to customize them , see wikipedia : signatures if you prefer to be less formal , leave off the title however , you should read the section on using your real name as your username you specify your username when creating an account , and subsequently use it ( together with your secret password ) to log in to that account once you have an account , you may create a user page , titled '' user : xxxx '' ( where '' xxxx '' is your username ) , to provide relevant information about yourself to other wikipedians you or any other editor may also create a user talk page , titled '' user talk : xxxx '' , that people can use to contact you the software will not allow you to register with a username that is already in use , or one that appears too similar to one that is already in use special : centralauth can be used to check whether a username is already taken or not ; if it is not listed there you can easily register it , unless it is too similar to an existing one with a similar username , you may still be able to obtain it under certain circumstances : see below your username can be virtually any string of characters ( subject to a few technical limitations ) usernames that give the impression that the account has permissions which it does not have ; e.g usernames including phrases such as '' wikipedia '' , '' wikimedia '' , '' wiktionary '' , '' ( wmf ) '' , or similar if they give the incorrect impression that the account may be officially affiliated with the wikimedia foundation or one of its projects usernames that resemble ip addresses ( as these are expected to designate non-logged-in users ) , timestamps or other names which would be confusing within the wikipedia signature format usernames that appear similar to naming conventions used by community administrative processes , such as those starting with vanished user ( see wikipedia : courtesy vanishing ) note that usernames that are inappropriate in another language , or that represent an inappropriate name with misspellings and substitutions , or do so indirectly or by implication , are still considered inappropriate the following types of usernames are not permitted because they are considered promotional : usernames that unambiguously represent the name of a company , group , institution or product ( e.g ) are sometimes acceptable , such as when the purpose is simply to identify the user as a person , they are inappropriate if they promote a commercial web page if there is evidence that the user would continue to edit inappropriately under a new username , the blocking administrator should enable the '' autoblock '' and '' prevent account creation '' features otherwise , the user should be offered the opportunity to create a new account because wikipedia 's policy is that usernames should not be shared between more than one individual , the following types of usernames are not permitted because they imply shared use : usernames that are simply names of companies or groups are not permitted ( these also fall under above ) usernames that are names of posts within organizations , such as '' secretary of the xy foundation '' , are not permitted , as such a post may be held by different persons at different times however , usernames are acceptable if they contain a company or group name but are clearly intended to denote an individual person , such as '' mark at widgetsusa '' , '' jack smith at the xy foundation '' , '' widgetfan87 '' , etc if you choose to edit articles that are in any way related to your company or group , you will need to carefully follow wikipedia 's advice on editing with a conflict of interest if you find an apparently problematic username being used by a long-standing editor , it is likely that the matter has been discussed before if the user with a bad username is breaching other policies , such as those against spam or wp : vand , follow up using those policies rather than reporting the username however , users who are reluctant to register a new username and are otherwise showing a positive history of contributions to wikipedia should be allowed to continue editing in a positive fashion and the matter should be dropped usernames that are very similar to existing ones can not be registered normallybut if you do want to use one , you may request its creation at wikipedia : request an account any user account should represent an individual and not a group ( and an individual should normally only have one user account ; see next section ) for example , a user may wish to create an alternate account for use on public computers as a precaution to keep their primary account more secure it is not possible to delete user accounts , as all contributions must be assigned to some identifier ; either a username or an ip address

indiana was constructed from a modified version of a design drawn up by a us navy policy board in 1889 for a short-range battleship policy of isolationism and did not approve it , but a year later the united states house of representatives approved funding for three coast defense battleships , which would become indiana and her sister ships and after further trials , the ship joined the north atlantic squadron under the command of rear admiral francis m bunce , which conducted training exercises along the east coast of the united states this convinced the navy that bilge keels—omitted during construction because , with them , the ship could not fit in most american dry docks—were necessary to reduce the rolling , and they were installed on all three ships of the indiana-class at the outbreak of the spanish–american war in april 1898 , indiana was at key west with the rest of the north atlantic squadron , at the time commanded by rear admiral william t cervera saw that his situation was desperate and attempted to break through the blockade on 3 july 1898 , resulting in the battle of santiago de cuba she was then ordered to keep up the blockade of the harbor in case more spanish ships came out and so played no role in the chase and sinking of the two remaining spanish cruisers , vizcaya and cristóbal colón the battleships were reactivated the following month as an experiment in how quickly this could be achieved , but indiana was placed in the reserve fleet again that winter after the united states entered world war i , indiana was commissioned for the third time and served as a training ship for gun crews near tompkinsville , staten island and in the york river , and placed under the command of george landenberger on 31 january 1919 she was decommissioned for the final time , and two months later she was renamed coast battleship number 1 so that the name indiana could be assigned to the newly authorized—but never completed—battleship indiana sank during the test and settled in the shallow water , where she remained until her wreck was sold for scrap on 19 march 1924 .

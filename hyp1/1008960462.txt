crossing the alps , hannibal reached the italian peninsula in 218 & nbsp ; bc and won several major victories against the roman armies the romans failed to defeat him in the field and he remained in italy , but following scipio 's decisive victory at the battle of ilipa in spain in 206 & nbsp ; bc , iberia had been secured by the romans in 205 & nbsp ; bc scipio returned to rome , where he was elected consul by unanimous vote he landed at utica and defeated the carthaginian army at the battle of the great plains in 203 & nbsp ; bc the panicked carthaginians felt that they had no alternative but to offer peace to scipio , and having the authority to do so , scipio granted peace on generous terms the carthaginian senate recalled hannibal , who was still in italy ( although confined to the south of the peninsula ) when scipio landed in africa , in 203 & nbsp ; bc hannibal led an army comprising spanish mercenaries , gauls allies , local citizens and veterans , and numidian cavalry from his italian campaigns scipio led a pre-marian roman army quincunx , along with a body of numidian cavalry this also gave an edge in turn to scipio , who relied greatly on his roman heavy cavalry and numidian light cavalry hannibal 's army consisted of 36,000 infantry , 4,000 cavalry and 80 war elephants , while scipio had a total of 29,000 infantry and 6,100 cavalry putting his cavalry on the flanks , with the inexperienced carthaginian cavalry on the right and the numidians on the left , hannibal aligned the rest of his troops in three straight lines behind his elephants hannibal intentionally held back his third infantry line , in order to thwart scipio 's tendency to pin the carthaginian center and envelop his opponent 's lines , as he had done at the battle of ilipa scipio deployed his army in three lines : the first was composed of the hastati , the second of principes and the third of the triarii the stronger right wing was composed of the numidian cavalry and commanded by masinissa , while the left was composed of italian cavalry under the command of laelius hannibal most likely believed that the combination of the war elephants and the depth of the first two lines would weaken and disorganize the roman advance scipio 's plan to neutralize the threat of the elephants had worked ; his troops then fell back into traditional roman battle formation the carthaginian cavalry , acting on the instructions of hannibal , allowed the roman cavalry to chase them in order to lure them away from the battlefield so that they would n't attack the carthaginian armies in the rear carthaginian cavalry carried out hannibal 's instructions well and there was no sign of roman cavalry on the battlefield the battle finally turned in the romans ' favor when the roman cavalry returned to the battlefield and attacked the carthaginian line from behind soon after scipio 's victory at zama the war ended , with the carthaginian senate suing for peace

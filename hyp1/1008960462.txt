crossing the alps , hannibal reached the italian peninsula in 218 & nbsp ; bc and won several major victories against the roman armies the romans failed to defeat him in the field and he remained in italy , but following scipio 's decisive victory at the battle of ilipa in spain in 206 & nbsp ; bc , iberia had been secured by the romans in 205 & nbsp ; bc scipio returned to rome , where he was elected consul by unanimous vote he landed at utica and defeated the carthaginian army at the battle of the great plains in 203 & nbsp ; bc the panicked carthaginians felt that they had no alternative but to offer peace to scipio , and having the authority to do so , scipio granted peace on generous terms the carthaginian senate recalled hannibal , who was still in italy ( although confined to the south of the peninsula ) when scipio landed in africa , in 203 & nbsp ; bc hannibal led an army comprising spanish mercenaries , gauls allies , local citizens and veterans , and numidian cavalry from his italian campaigns scipio led a pre-marian roman army quincunx , along with a body of numidian cavalry hannibal deployed his troops facing northwest , while scipio deployed his troops in front of the carthaginian army facing southeast hannibal 's army consisted of 36,000 infantry , 4,000 cavalry and 80 war elephants , while scipio had a total of 29,000 infantry and 6,100 cavalry putting his cavalry on the flanks , with the inexperienced carthaginian cavalry on the right and the numidians on the left , hannibal aligned the rest of his troops in three straight lines behind his elephants carey , hannibal 's last battle , p.116 the first line consisted of mixed infantry of mercenaries from gaul , liguria and the balearic islands hannibal and the carthaginians had relied on cavalry superiority in previous battles such as cannae , but scipio , recognizing their importance , held the cavalry advantage at zama hannibal most likely believed that the combination of the war elephants and the depth of the first two lines would weaken and disorganize the roman advance scipio 's plan to neutralize the threat of the elephants had worked ; his troops then fell back into traditional roman battle formation hannibal ordered his second line not to allow the first line in their ranks hannibal now charged with his second line carthaginian cavalry carried out hannibal 's instructions well and there was no sign of roman cavalry on the battlefield soon after scipio 's victory at zama the war ended , with the carthaginian senate suing for peace this allowed the romans to establish a casus belli for the third punic war about 50 years later , after the carthaginians defended themselves from numidian encroachments , against which the romans did not initially intervene

crossing the alps , hannibal reached the italian peninsula in 218 & nbsp ; bc and won several major victories against the roman armies the romans failed to defeat him in the field and he remained in italy , but following scipio 's decisive victory at the battle of ilipa in spain in 206 & nbsp ; bc , iberia had been secured by the romans in 205 & nbsp ; bc scipio returned to rome , where he was elected consul by unanimous vote he landed at utica and defeated the carthaginian army at the battle of the great plains in 203 & nbsp ; bc the panicked carthaginians felt that they had no alternative but to offer peace to scipio , and having the authority to do so , scipio granted peace on generous terms hannibal led an army comprising spanish mercenaries , gauls allies , local citizens and veterans , and numidian cavalry from his italian campaigns scipio led a pre-marian roman army quincunx , along with a body of numidian cavalry hannibal was first to march and reach the plains of zama regia , which were suitable for cavalry maneuvering this also gave an edge in turn to scipio , who relied greatly on his roman heavy cavalry and numidian light cavalry hannibal deployed his troops facing northwest , while scipio deployed his troops in front of the carthaginian army facing southeast hannibal 's army consisted of 36,000 infantry , 4,000 cavalry and 80 war elephants , while scipio had a total of 29,000 infantry and 6,100 cavalry in his second line he placed the carthaginian and libyan citizen levies , while his veterans from italy , including mercenaries from gaul and hispania , were placed in the third line hannibal intentionally held back his third infantry line , in order to thwart scipio 's tendency to pin the carthaginian center and envelop his opponent 's lines , as he had done at the battle of ilipa scipio deployed his army in three lines : the first was composed of the hastati , the second of principes and the third of the triarii at the outset of the battle , hannibal unleashed his elephants and skirmishers against the roman army in order to break the cohesion of their lines and exploit the breaches that could be opened with this reinforcement the roman front renewed their attack and defeated hannibal 's second line carthaginian cavalry carried out hannibal 's instructions well and there was no sign of roman cavalry on the battlefield once the carthaginian cavalry was far enough away , they turned and attacked the roman cavalry but were eventually routed the battle finally turned in the romans ' favor when the roman cavalry returned to the battlefield and attacked the carthaginian line from behind one provision of the treaty ending the second punic war was that the carthaginians were not allowed to make war without roman consent

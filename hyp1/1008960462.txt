crossing the alps , hannibal reached the italian peninsula in 218 & nbsp ; bc and won several major victories against the roman armies the romans failed to defeat him in the field and he remained in italy , but following scipio 's decisive victory at the battle of ilipa in spain in 206 & nbsp ; bc , iberia had been secured by the romans in 205 & nbsp ; bc scipio returned to rome , where he was elected consul by unanimous vote scipio , now powerful enough , proposed to end the war by directly invading the tunisia scipio and his supporters eventually convinced the senate to ratify the plan , and scipio was given the requisite authority to attempt the invasion he landed at utica and defeated the carthaginian army at the battle of the great plains in 203 & nbsp ; bc the panicked carthaginians felt that they had no alternative but to offer peace to scipio , and having the authority to do so , scipio granted peace on generous terms the carthaginian senate recalled hannibal , who was still in italy ( although confined to the south of the peninsula ) when scipio landed in africa , in 203 & nbsp ; bc hannibal led an army comprising spanish mercenaries , gauls allies , local citizens and veterans , and numidian cavalry from his italian campaigns scipio led a pre-marian roman army quincunx , along with a body of numidian cavalry hannibal was first to march and reach the plains of zama regia , which were suitable for cavalry maneuvering this also gave an edge in turn to scipio , who relied greatly on his roman heavy cavalry and numidian light cavalry hannibal deployed his troops facing northwest , while scipio deployed his troops in front of the carthaginian army facing southeast hannibal 's army consisted of 36,000 infantry , 4,000 cavalry and 80 war elephants , while scipio had a total of 29,000 infantry and 6,100 cavalry hannibal intentionally held back his third infantry line , in order to thwart scipio 's tendency to pin the carthaginian center and envelop his opponent 's lines , as he had done at the battle of ilipa the stronger right wing was composed of the numidian cavalry and commanded by masinissa , while the left was composed of italian cavalry under the command of laelius hannibal and the carthaginians had relied on cavalry superiority in previous battles such as cannae , but scipio , recognizing their importance , held the cavalry advantage at zama with this reinforcement the roman front renewed their attack and defeated hannibal 's second line once the carthaginian cavalry was far enough away , they turned and attacked the roman cavalry but were eventually routed the battle finally turned in the romans ' favor when the roman cavalry returned to the battlefield and attacked the carthaginian line from behind

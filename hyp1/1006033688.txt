the township was established at the base of the former roman fortress of levefanum in the 7th century the frankish carolingian empire and the frisians fought for control of the territory , until the franks gained control of the frisian coast in 719 dorestad flourished between the 7th century and the mid-9th century the settlement was well known for minting coins under the control of several frankish rulers as a result , the franks and the frisians fought over control of the township the franks won out at the end of the 7th century and closely monitored the growth of dorestad , which led to dorestad 's economic expansion via international trade and the establishment of a mint in the upper town it is assumed that there was a toll as well as harbour fees , collected by the king 's representatives at dorestad over time , many coins have been discovered in the dorestad area , supporting the idea of rapid growth and control of the harbour as well as the presence of a mint as a result , the franks slowly lost interest in the town and granted the church of utrecht responsibility over a sizeable portion of dorestad a division occurred in the frankish empire , and louis the pious was removed from the throne by his son however , lothair i was unable to protect dorestad and the other frankish territories from economic turmoil the first was that the franks lost even more interest in dorestad and as a result , even more control was transferred to the church the second was that lothair i was stirring up trouble for the franks by encouraging viking raids on the frisian coast when he was exiled although dorestad was raided only once , in 834 , it seems that the town never fully recovered afterwards the franks allowed hroerekr to take control of the land as long as he protected the coast from viking invasions the coast was battered by viking attacks , but it seems that dorestad was left relatively unscathed by the 9th century , it seems that the need for international trade was waning as regional trade gained importance that created conflict between the franks and the danes as hroerekr established a gang of men to attack the coast while frankish defence was organized , that did not stop the danes from capturing dorestad and a large portion of the frisian coast in 850 because of its wealth and success as a trade centre , dorestad got the attention of vikings in the 9th century after the death of louis the pious in 840 a new feud developed between his three sons , but over in frisia , lothair had a strong position because of the danish warlords that were situated in r√ºstringen , dorestad and walcheren the valuable piece of jewellery may have been placed in the well to protect it from danger , for example the attacks of the vikings on dorestad

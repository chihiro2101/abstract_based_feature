usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient the charge distribution on the substrate and active site must be complementary , which means all positive and negative charges must be cancelled out the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur for example , alcohol dehydrogenase which catalyses the transfer of a hydride ion from ethanol to nadh interacts with the substrate methyl group , hydroxyl group and the pro- ( r ) hydrogen that will be abstracted during the reaction to maintain this defined three-dimensional structure , proteins rely on various types of interactions between their amino acid residues a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction if the tightness between the active site of dna polymerase and its substrate is increased , the fidelity , which means the correct rate of dna replication will also increase there are three proposed models of how enzymes fit their specific substrate : the lock and key model , the induced fit model , and the conformational selection model if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency for example , the competitive enzyme inhibitor methylglucoside can bind tightly to the active site of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and perfectly fits into it however , 4-alpha-glucanotransferase is not active on methylglucoside and no glycosyl transfer occurs daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary this model is similar to a person wearing a glove : the glove changes shape to fit the hand the enzyme initially has a conformation that attracts its substrate electrostatic interaction : in an aqueous environment , the oppositely charged groups in amino acid side chains within the active site and substrates attract each other , which is termed electrostatic interaction the strength of hydrogen bond depends on the chemical nature and geometric arrangement of each group although the individual force is weak , as the total number of interactions between the active site and substrate is massive the sum of them will be significant when dissolving in water a protein molecule will curl up into a ball-like shape , leaving hydrophilic groups in outside while hydrophobic groups are deeply buried within the centre once the substrate is bound and oriented to the active site , catalysis can begin during enzyme catalytic reaction , the substrate and active site are brought together in a close proximity in solution substrate molecules are surrounded by solvent molecules and energy is required for enzyme molecules to replace them and contact with the substrate since bulk molecules can be excluded from the active site this energy output can be minimised in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy the electrostatic states of substrate and active site must be complementary to each other nucleophilic catalysis : this process involves the donation of electrons from the enzyme 's nucleophile to a substrate to form a covalent bond between them during the transition state firstly it can bind to negatively charged substrate groups so they will not repel electron pairs from active site 's nucleophilic groups it can also bridge between active site and substrate in the active site , there are two cysteine residues besides the fad cofactor and are used to break the disulphide bond during the catalytic reaction only when its cofactor comes in and binds to the active site to form holoenzyme does it work properly they can also induce transient conformational changes in the active site so substrates can not fit perfectly with it they usually bind to a different site on the enzyme and alter the 3-dimensional structure of the active site to block substrates from entry or leaving the enzyme thumb an regulatory site is a site on an enzyme , unrelated to its active site , which can bind an effector molecule they allow an enzyme to have a range of molecular interactions , other than the highly specific active site

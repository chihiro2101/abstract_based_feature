usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient the charge distribution on the substrate and active site must be complementary , which means all positive and negative charges must be cancelled out the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur the binding of substrate to the binding site requires at least three contact points in order to achieve stereo- , regio- , and enantioselectivity to maintain this defined three-dimensional structure , proteins rely on various types of interactions between their amino acid residues a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction most enzymes have deeply buried active sites , which can be accessed by a substrate via access channels there are three proposed models of how enzymes fit their specific substrate : the lock and key model , the induced fit model , and the conformational selection model he proposed that the active site and substrate are two stable structures that fit perfectly without any further modification , just like a key fits into a lock if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency for example , the competitive enzyme inhibitor methylglucoside can bind tightly to the active site of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and perfectly fits into it daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary the enzyme initially has a conformation that attracts its substrate after the reaction products will move away from the enzyme and the active site returns to its initial shape this model suggests that enzymes exist in a variety of conformations , only some of which are capable of binding to a substrate electrostatic interaction : in an aqueous environment , the oppositely charged groups in amino acid side chains within the active site and substrates attract each other , which is termed electrostatic interaction when dissolving in water a protein molecule will curl up into a ball-like shape , leaving hydrophilic groups in outside while hydrophobic groups are deeply buried within the centre once the substrate is bound and oriented to the active site , catalysis can begin during enzyme catalytic reaction , the substrate and active site are brought together in a close proximity this process also reduces the solvation required for the reaction to occur since bulk molecules can be excluded from the active site this energy output can be minimised next , the active site is designed to reorient the substrate to reduce the activation energy for the reaction to occur in addition , this binding is favoured by entropy as the energy cost associated with solution reaction is largely eliminated since solvent can not enter active site a polarized negatively charged amino acid side chain will repel uncharged substrate many enzymes including serine protease , cysteine protease , protein kinase and phosphatase evolved to form transient covalent bonds between them and their substrates to lower the activation energy and allow the reaction to occur it can also bridge between active site and substrate at last , they may change the conformational structure of the substrate to favour reaction in some reactions , protons and hydroxide may directly act as acid and base in term of specific acid and specific base catalysis the formation of transition state within the solution requires a large amount of energy to relocate solvent molecules and the reaction is slowed in the active site of this enzyme , three amino acid residues work together to form a catalytic triad which makes up the catalytic site inhibitors disrupt the interaction between enzyme and substrate , slowing down the rate of a reaction enzyme inhibitor are similar to competitive inhibitors as they both bind to the active site thumb an regulatory site is a site on an enzyme , unrelated to its active site , which can bind an effector molecule

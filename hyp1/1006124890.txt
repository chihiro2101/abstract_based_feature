usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient there are four important types of interaction that hold the substrate in a defined orientation and form an enzyme-substrate complex ( es complex ) : hydrogen bonds , van der waals force , hydrophobic interactions and electrostatic interactions the charge distribution on the substrate and active site must be complementary , which means all positive and negative charges must be cancelled out the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur the binding of substrate to the binding site requires at least three contact points in order to achieve stereo- , regio- , and enantioselectivity in order to exert their function , enzymes need to assume their correct protein fold ( native fold ) and tertiary structure to maintain this defined three-dimensional structure , proteins rely on various types of interactions between their amino acid residues a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction there are three proposed models of how enzymes fit their specific substrate : the lock and key model , the induced fit model , and the conformational selection model amino acids at the binding site of ubiquitin generally follow the induced fit model , whereas the rest of the protein generally adheres to conformational selection if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency apart from competitive inhibition , this theory can not explain the mechanism of action of non-competitive inhibition either , as they do not bind to the active site but nevertheless influence catalytic activity daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary the induced fit model is a development of the lock-and-key model and assumes that an active site is flexible and changes shape until the substrate is completely bound after the reaction products will move away from the enzyme and the active site returns to its initial shape this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the entire protein domain could move several nanometers during catalysis electrostatic interaction : in an aqueous environment , the oppositely charged groups in amino acid side chains within the active site and substrates attract each other , which is termed electrostatic interaction the strength of hydrogen bond depends on the chemical nature and geometric arrangement of each group the residues of the catalytic site are typically very close to the binding site , and some residues can have dual-roles in both binding and catalysis mechanisms involved in catalytic process firstly , when substrates bind within the active site the thermodynamic activity of it significantly increases than in solution in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy nucleophilic catalysis : this process involves the donation of electrons from the enzyme 's nucleophile to a substrate to form a covalent bond between them during the transition state both groups are also affected by their chemical properties such as polarizability , electronegativity and ionization energy electrophilic catalysis : the mechanism behind this process is exactly same as nucleophilic catalysis except that now amino acids in active site act as electrophile while substrates are nucleophiles this reaction usually requires cofactors as the amino acid side chains are not strong enough in attracting electrons it can also bridge between active site and substrate in some reactions , protons and hydroxide may directly act as acid and base in term of specific acid and specific base catalysis so conformational distortion was introduced and argues that both active site and substrate can undergo conformational changes to fit with each other all the time in the active site of this enzyme , three amino acid residues work together to form a catalytic triad which makes up the catalytic site they usually bind to a different site on the enzyme and alter the 3-dimensional structure of the active site to block substrates from entry or leaving the enzyme however , irreversible inhibitors form irreversible covalent bonds with the amino acid residues in the active site and never leave thumb an regulatory site is a site on an enzyme , unrelated to its active site , which can bind an effector molecule

usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient the charge distribution on the substrate and active site must be complementary , which means all positive and negative charges must be cancelled out the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur the binding of substrate to the binding site requires at least three contact points in order to achieve stereo- , regio- , and enantioselectivity to maintain this defined three-dimensional structure , proteins rely on various types of interactions between their amino acid residues a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction most enzymes have deeply buried active sites , which can be accessed by a substrate via access channels if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency apart from competitive inhibition , this theory can not explain the mechanism of action of non-competitive inhibition either , as they do not bind to the active site but nevertheless influence catalytic activity daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary the induced fit model is a development of the lock-and-key model and assumes that an active site is flexible and changes shape until the substrate is completely bound the enzyme initially has a conformation that attracts its substrate enzyme surface is flexible and only the correct catalyst can induce interaction leading to catalysis after the reaction products will move away from the enzyme and the active site returns to its initial shape if all electrons are concentrated at one pole of the group this end will be negative , while the other end will be positive although the individual force is weak , as the total number of interactions between the active site and substrate is massive the sum of them will be significant these hydrophobic groups usually have long carbon chain and do not react with water molecules once the substrate is bound and oriented to the active site , catalysis can begin the residues of the catalytic site are typically very close to the binding site , and some residues can have dual-roles in both binding and catalysis catalytic residues of the site interact with the substrate to lower the activation energy of a reaction and thereby make it proceed faster during enzyme catalytic reaction , the substrate and active site are brought together in a close proximity firstly , when substrates bind within the active site the thermodynamic activity of it significantly increases than in solution this means the number of substrate molecules involved in the reaction is also increased since bulk molecules can be excluded from the active site this energy output can be minimised next , the active site is designed to reorient the substrate to reduce the activation energy for the reaction to occur the alignment of the substrate , after binding , is locked in a high energy state and can proceed to the next step the electrostatic states of substrate and active site must be complementary to each other : the ability of the nucleophilic group to donate electrons and the electrophile to accept them the former one is mainly affected by the basicity ( the ability to donate electron pairs ) of the species while the later one is in regard to its pk a electrophilic catalysis : the mechanism behind this process is exactly same as nucleophilic catalysis except that now amino acids in active site act as electrophile while substrates are nucleophiles mostly they are connected to the active site by non-covalent bonds such as hydrogen bond or hydrophobic interaction they usually bind to a different site on the enzyme and alter the 3-dimensional structure of the active site to block substrates from entry or leaving the enzyme thumb an regulatory site is a site on an enzyme , unrelated to its active site , which can bind an effector molecule

usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate an active site contains a binding site that binds the substrate and orients it for catalysis the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction amino acids at the binding site of ubiquitin generally follow the induced fit model , whereas the rest of the protein generally adheres to conformational selection factors such as temperature likely influences the pathway taken during binding , with higher temperatures predicted to increase the importance of conformational selection and decrease that of induced fit he proposed that the active site and substrate are two stable structures that fit perfectly without any further modification , just like a key fits into a lock if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency for example , the competitive enzyme inhibitor methylglucoside can bind tightly to the active site of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and perfectly fits into it however , 4-alpha-glucanotransferase is not active on methylglucoside and no glycosyl transfer occurs apart from competitive inhibition , this theory can not explain the mechanism of action of non-competitive inhibition either , as they do not bind to the active site but nevertheless influence catalytic activity daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary after the reaction products will move away from the enzyme and the active site returns to its initial shape this hypothesis is supported by the observation that the entire protein domain could move several nanometers during catalysis for example , when a carboxylic acid ( r-cooh ) dissociates into rcoo − and h + ions , coo − will attract positively charged groups such as protonated guanidine side chain of arginine if all electrons are concentrated at one pole of the group this end will be negative , while the other end will be positive although the individual force is weak , as the total number of interactions between the active site and substrate is massive the sum of them will be significant these hydrophobic groups usually have long carbon chain and do not react with water molecules the residues of the catalytic site are typically very close to the binding site , and some residues can have dual-roles in both binding and catalysis this means the number of substrate molecules involved in the reaction is also increased this process also reduces the solvation required for the reaction to occur in solution substrate molecules are surrounded by solvent molecules and energy is required for enzyme molecules to replace them and contact with the substrate next , the active site is designed to reorient the substrate to reduce the activation energy for the reaction to occur the alignment of the substrate , after binding , is locked in a high energy state and can proceed to the next step the electrostatic states of substrate and active site must be complementary to each other but if the transition state involves the formation of an ion centre then the side chain will now produce a favourable interaction both groups are also affected by their chemical properties such as polarizability , electronegativity and ionization energy electrophilic catalysis : the mechanism behind this process is exactly same as nucleophilic catalysis except that now amino acids in active site act as electrophile while substrates are nucleophiles firstly it can bind to negatively charged substrate groups so they will not repel electron pairs from active site 's nucleophilic groups at last , they may change the conformational structure of the substrate to favour reaction but more often groups in substrate and active site act as brønsted–lowry acid and base this is called general acid and general base theory they usually bind to a different site on the enzyme and alter the 3-dimensional structure of the active site to block substrates from entry or leaving the enzyme thumb an regulatory site is a site on an enzyme , unrelated to its active site , which can bind an effector molecule

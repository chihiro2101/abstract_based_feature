usually , an enzyme molecule has only two active sites , and the active sites fit with one specific type of substrate the orientation of the substrate and the close proximity between it and the active site is so important that in some cases the enzyme can still function properly even though all other parts are mutated and lose function initially , the interaction between the active site and the substrate is non-covalent and transient the charge distribution on the substrate and active site must be complementary , which means all positive and negative charges must be cancelled out the active site usually contains non-polar amino acids , although sometimes polar amino acids may also occur a tighter fit between an active site and the substrate molecule is believed to increase the efficiency of a reaction there are three proposed models of how enzymes fit their specific substrate : the lock and key model , the induced fit model , and the conformational selection model he proposed that the active site and substrate are two stable structures that fit perfectly without any further modification , just like a key fits into a lock if one substrate perfectly binds to its active site , the interactions between them will be strongest , resulting in high catalytic efficiency for example , the competitive enzyme inhibitor methylglucoside can bind tightly to the active site of 4-alpha-glucanotransferase and perfectly fits into it apart from competitive inhibition , this theory can not explain the mechanism of action of non-competitive inhibition either , as they do not bind to the active site but nevertheless influence catalytic activity daniel koshland 's theory of enzyme-substrate binding is that the active site and the binding portion of the substrate are not exactly complementary the induced fit model is a development of the lock-and-key model and assumes that an active site is flexible and changes shape until the substrate is completely bound this model is similar to a person wearing a glove : the glove changes shape to fit the hand enzyme surface is flexible and only the correct catalyst can induce interaction leading to catalysis electrostatic interaction : in an aqueous environment , the oppositely charged groups in amino acid side chains within the active site and substrates attract each other , which is termed electrostatic interaction van der waals force : van der waals force is formed between oppositely charged groups due to transient uneven electron distribution in each group although the individual force is weak , as the total number of interactions between the active site and substrate is massive the sum of them will be significant hydrophobic interaction : non-polar hydrophobic groups tend to aggregate together in the aqueous environment and try to leave from polar solvent these hydrophobic groups usually have long carbon chain and do not react with water molecules the residues of the catalytic site are typically very close to the binding site , and some residues can have dual-roles in both binding and catalysis mechanisms involved in catalytic process during enzyme catalytic reaction , the substrate and active site are brought together in a close proximity this means the number of substrate molecules involved in the reaction is also increased this process also reduces the solvation required for the reaction to occur in the end , the active site may manipulate the molecular orbital of the substrate into a suitable orientation to reduce activation energy the electrostatic states of substrate and active site must be complementary to each other both groups are also affected by their chemical properties such as polarizability , electronegativity and ionization energy amino acids that can form nucleophile including serine , cysteine , aspartate and glutamine this reaction usually requires cofactors as the amino acid side chains are not strong enough in attracting electrons firstly it can bind to negatively charged substrate groups so they will not repel electron pairs from active site 's nucleophilic groups in some reactions , protons and hydroxide may directly act as acid and base in term of specific acid and specific base catalysis the active site is located in the linkage between two subunits in the active site of this enzyme , three amino acid residues work together to form a catalytic triad which makes up the catalytic site enzyme inhibitor are similar to competitive inhibitors as they both bind to the active site they allow an enzyme to have a range of molecular interactions , other than the highly specific active site

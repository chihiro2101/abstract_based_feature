during world war 2 the german wehrmacht infantry squad or gruppe was mainly a general purpose machine gun ( gpmg ) based unit the advantage of the general purpose machine gun concept was that it added greatly to the overall volume of fire that could be put out by a squad-sized unit an infantry gruppe consisted of ten men ; a non-commissioned officer or unteroffizier squad leader , deputy squad leader , a three-man machine gun team ( machine gunner , assistant gunner and ammunition carrier ) and five riflemen as personal small arms the squad leader was issued a rifle or as of around 1941 a submachine gun , the machine gunner and his assistant were issued pistols and the deputy squad leader , ammunition carrier and the riflemen were issued rifles the riflemen carried additional ammunition , hand grenades , explosive charges or a machine gun tripod as required and provided security and covering fire for the machine gun team historically , a '' squad '' in the us army was a sub-unit of a section , consisting of from as few as two soldiers to as many as 12 and was originally used primarily for drill and administrative purposes ( e.g in 1891 , the us army officially defined a rifle '' squad '' as consisting of '' seven privates and one corporal the us army employed the eight-man rifle squad through wwi and until the late 1930s under the square division organizational plan , in which sergeants continued to lead sections consisting of two squads instead , the squads were reorganized into a 12-man unit of three elements , or teams , mahon 1972 , p.73 able , baker , and charlie , reporting directly to the platoon leader ( an officer , usually a second lieutenant ) , assisted by a sergeant assigned as the '' assistant to platoon commander '' ( re-designated as '' platoon leader '' in 1940 and as '' platoon sergeant '' in 1943 with the officer then re-designated as '' platoon leader '' ) the squad leader was still only a corporal but the squad was also assigned a pfc ( one of the scout riflemen ) as the assistant to the squad leader this adjustment raised the squad leader to a sergeant ( grade 4 ) and the assistant squad leader to a corporal ( grade 5 ) the '' platoon leader '' ( with the officer still being the '' platoon commander '' ) now became a staff sergeant , ( grade 3 ) ) this squad organization included two men serving as reconnaissance who along with the squad leader , formed the security element ( i.e ” the second element was a three-man browning automatic rifle ( bar ) team consisting of an automatic rifleman , an assistant automatic rifleman and an ammunition bearer ” lastly , there were five riflemen and the assistant squad leader , who formed the “ maneuver element ” ( e.g ” in 1942 , the army had a massive restructuring of its tables of organization & equipment ( to & es ) and increased the rank of the squad leader and assistant squad leader to staff sergeant and sergeant , respectively ( in 1943 nco platoon leaders were re-designated as platoon sergeants and officer platoon commanders became platoon leaders the baker element 's ammunition bearer was also eliminated , leaving the two-man bar team as the base of fire , supervised by the assistant squad leader ( again called a corporal ) , but remaining as a grade 4 , since the rank of sergeant ( three chevrons ) was then eliminated ) the five riflemen of the “ charlie ” team , now led by the squad leader , remained as the maneuver element in 1951 the pay grades were reversed , with master sergeant becoming e-7 ( vice the previous grade 1 ) and sergeant first class becoming e-6 , so that the squad leader became a sergeant ( e-5 ) and the assistant squad leader , a corporal ( e-4 ) the assistant squad leader position was eliminated , with the senior fire team leader now filling this role as needed this iteration of the rifle squad retained the two fire teams but eliminated the two scouts ( one in each fire team ) , instead providing the squad leader with one extra rifleman , who could be used to reinforce either fire team or assist the squad leader as required ( also , in 1968 , the separate rank title of platoon sergeant was eliminated , leaving sfc as the only e-7 rank ) currently , us army rifle squads consist of nine soldiers , organized under a squad leader into two four-man fire teams bmp rifle squads consisted of a squad leader/bmp commander , assistant squad leader/bmp gunner , a bmp driver/mechanic , a machine gunner armed with an rpk-74 , a grenadier armed with an rpg-7 , a rifleman/assistant grenadier , a rifleman/medic , a senior rifleman and a rifleman all armed with akms or ak-74s in the military , a squad leader is a non-commissioned officer who leads a squad of typically 9 soldiers ( us army : squad leader and two fireteams of 4 men each ) or 13 marines ( us marine corps : squad leader and three fireteams of 4 men each ) in a rifle squad , or 3 to 8 men in a crew-served weapons squad polish army : the drużyna ( squad ) is normally led by a kapral ( corporal ) , starszy kapral or plutonowy but the first squad of a platoon is led by a sierżant ( sergeant ) contubernium death squad execution by firing squad military organizations military science organization of canadian army rifle sections during world war ii squadron

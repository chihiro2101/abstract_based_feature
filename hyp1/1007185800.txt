during world war 2 the german wehrmacht infantry squad or gruppe was mainly a general purpose machine gun ( gpmg ) based unit the advantage of the general purpose machine gun concept was that it added greatly to the overall volume of fire that could be put out by a squad-sized unit an infantry gruppe consisted of ten men ; a non-commissioned officer or unteroffizier squad leader , deputy squad leader , a three-man machine gun team ( machine gunner , assistant gunner and ammunition carrier ) and five riflemen as personal small arms the squad leader was issued a rifle or as of around 1941 a submachine gun , the machine gunner and his assistant were issued pistols and the deputy squad leader , ammunition carrier and the riflemen were issued rifles the riflemen carried additional ammunition , hand grenades , explosive charges or a machine gun tripod as required and provided security and covering fire for the machine gun team two of the standard issue bolt-action karabiner 98k rifles in the squad could be replaced with semi-automatic gewehr 43 rifles and occasionally , stg-44 assault rifles could be used to re-arm the whole squad , besides the machine-gun historically , a '' squad '' in the us army was a sub-unit of a section , consisting of from as few as two soldiers to as many as 12 and was originally used primarily for drill and administrative purposes ( e.g in 1891 , the us army officially defined a rifle '' squad '' as consisting of '' seven privates and one corporal the us army employed the eight-man rifle squad through wwi and until the late 1930s under the square division organizational plan , in which sergeants continued to lead sections consisting of two squads ) the squad leader was still only a corporal but the squad was also assigned a pfc ( one of the scout riflemen ) as the assistant to the squad leader this soldier could serve as either the squad leader 's messenger to the platoon commander or could be used to relay orders to other squad elements , as needed while not a noncommissioned officer ( nco ) the pfc was an experienced soldier , as prior to wwii the majority of enlisted men remained privates for the entire term of their enlistment since promotion opportunity was scarce , leadership and supervision ) weakness of so large a squad under one nco rapidly became obvious in light of the pre-war mobilization and was corrected in 1940 when a second nco was added to the squad the '' platoon leader '' ( with the officer still being the '' platoon commander '' ) now became a staff sergeant , ( grade 3 ) ” lastly , there were five riflemen and the assistant squad leader , who formed the “ maneuver element ” ( e.g ” in 1942 , the army had a massive restructuring of its tables of organization & equipment ( to & es ) and increased the rank of the squad leader and assistant squad leader to staff sergeant and sergeant , respectively ( in 1943 nco platoon leaders were re-designated as platoon sergeants and officer platoon commanders became platoon leaders also , in 1948 , the rank title of the platoon sergeant changed from technical sergeant ( which was eliminated ) to sergeant first class ( sfc ) ( grade 2 ) and the rank title of first sergeant was again eliminated , being retained only as an occupational title for the senior nco of a company the rifle squad was reorganized into an eleven-man organization with a sergeant ( e-5 ) as squad leader and two five-man fire teams 91 each fire team consisted of a corporal ( e-4 ) team leader , an automatic rifleman , an assistant automatic rifleman , a grenadier , and a scout-rifleman the assistant squad leader position was eliminated , with the senior fire team leader now filling this role as needed ( platoon sergeant became a separate rank title , and along with sfc , became e-7 ; first sergeants and master sergeants became pay grade e-8 an exception was in mechanized infantry units , where an additional rifleman ( increasing the squad to eleven members ) was assigned as the driver of the squad 's m113 armored personnel carrier these squads range from as few as three marines ( 60mm lwcm squad ) to as many as eight ( javelin missile squad ) , depending upon the weapon system with which the squad is equipped the squad , grupp , in the swedish army is organized as follows during offensive missions , according to markstridsreglemente 3 grupp ( ground combat regulation 3 squad ) : gruppchef – squad leader a danish mechanized infantry squad ( gruppe ) consists of 9 privates and a sergent , subdivided into 5 pairs , or “ buddies ” a squad is led by an nco known as a squad leader squad leaders of crew-served weapons squads range from corporal through staff sergeant , depending upon the branch of service and type of squad german army : feldwebel or oberfeldwebel ( previously unteroffizier / unterfeldwebel ; until 1945 obergefreiter in the wehrmacht or ss-rottenführer in the waffen-ss ) israel defense forces : sergeant ( samál ) or staff sergeant ( samár ) norwegian army : sergeant ( noc is corporal and leads the light machine gun fire team of the squad )

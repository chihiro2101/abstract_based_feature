during world war 2 the german wehrmacht infantry squad or gruppe was mainly a general purpose machine gun ( gpmg ) based unit an infantry gruppe consisted of ten men ; a non-commissioned officer or unteroffizier squad leader , deputy squad leader , a three-man machine gun team ( machine gunner , assistant gunner and ammunition carrier ) and five riflemen as personal small arms the squad leader was issued a rifle or as of around 1941 a submachine gun , the machine gunner and his assistant were issued pistols and the deputy squad leader , ammunition carrier and the riflemen were issued rifles united states war department , military intelligence service , december 25 , 1943 two of the standard issue bolt-action karabiner 98k rifles in the squad could be replaced with semi-automatic gewehr 43 rifles and occasionally , stg-44 assault rifles could be used to re-arm the whole squad , besides the machine-gun historically , a '' squad '' in the us army was a sub-unit of a section , consisting of from as few as two soldiers to as many as 12 and was originally used primarily for drill and administrative purposes ( e.g in 1891 , the us army officially defined a rifle '' squad '' as consisting of '' seven privates and one corporal the us army employed the eight-man rifle squad through wwi and until the late 1930s under the square division organizational plan , in which sergeants continued to lead sections consisting of two squads instead , the squads were reorganized into a 12-man unit of three elements , or teams , mahon 1972 , p.73 able , baker , and charlie , reporting directly to the platoon leader ( an officer , usually a second lieutenant ) , assisted by a sergeant assigned as the '' assistant to platoon commander '' ( re-designated as '' platoon leader '' in 1940 and as '' platoon sergeant '' in 1943 with the officer then re-designated as '' platoon leader '' ) the squad leader was still only a corporal but the squad was also assigned a pfc ( one of the scout riflemen ) as the assistant to the squad leader this soldier could serve as either the squad leader 's messenger to the platoon commander or could be used to relay orders to other squad elements , as needed , leadership and supervision ) weakness of so large a squad under one nco rapidly became obvious in light of the pre-war mobilization and was corrected in 1940 when a second nco was added to the squad ” the second element was a three-man browning automatic rifle ( bar ) team consisting of an automatic rifleman , an assistant automatic rifleman and an ammunition bearer , fire support in providing suppressive fires in the attack and protective fires in the defense ) and was designated as “ baker ” lastly , there were five riflemen and the assistant squad leader , who formed the “ maneuver element ” ( e.g ” in 1942 , the army had a massive restructuring of its tables of organization & equipment ( to & es ) and increased the rank of the squad leader and assistant squad leader to staff sergeant and sergeant , respectively ) the two scouts of the able element were eliminated with the idea that all of the riflemen should be able to perform the scouting duties and would therefore all share in the associated inherent risk of that position ) in the 1956 the army began reorganizing into its '' pentomic ” plan under the rocid ( reorganization of current infantry divisions ) to & es the 1958 restructuring restored the traditional sergeant and staff sergeant rank insignia of three chevrons and three chevrons over an inverted arc , respectively an exception was in mechanized infantry units , where an additional rifleman ( increasing the squad to eleven members ) was assigned as the driver of the squad 's m113 armored personnel carrier ( also , in 1968 , the separate rank title of platoon sergeant was eliminated , leaving sfc as the only e-7 rank ) currently , us army rifle squads consist of nine soldiers , organized under a squad leader into two four-man fire teams us army , fm 100-2-3 the soviet army : troops , organization and equipment , 4–3 an infantry squad from an elite german-trained division would ideally have one light machine gun and 10 rifles , but only one of the three squads in a non-elite central army division would have a light machine gun the squad , grupp , in the swedish army is organized as follows during offensive missions , according to markstridsreglemente 3 grupp ( ground combat regulation 3 squad ) : gruppchef – squad leader in some armies , notably those of the british commonwealth , in which the term section is used for units of this size , the nco in charge , which in the british army and royal marines is normally a corporal ( or-4 ) , is termed a section commander typical ranks for squad leaders are : australian army : corporal austrian army : wachtmeister , oberwachtmeister brazilian army : in the brazilian army , a esquadra ( squad ) includes four soldiers led by a cabo ( corporal ) polish army : the drużyna ( squad ) is normally led by a kapral ( corporal ) , starszy kapral or plutonowy but the first squad of a platoon is led by a sierżant ( sergeant )

during world war 2 the german wehrmacht infantry squad or gruppe was mainly a general purpose machine gun ( gpmg ) based unit the advantage of the general purpose machine gun concept was that it added greatly to the overall volume of fire that could be put out by a squad-sized unit an infantry gruppe consisted of ten men ; a non-commissioned officer or unteroffizier squad leader , deputy squad leader , a three-man machine gun team ( machine gunner , assistant gunner and ammunition carrier ) and five riflemen as personal small arms the squad leader was issued a rifle or as of around 1941 a submachine gun , the machine gunner and his assistant were issued pistols and the deputy squad leader , ammunition carrier and the riflemen were issued rifles two of the standard issue bolt-action karabiner 98k rifles in the squad could be replaced with semi-automatic gewehr 43 rifles and occasionally , stg-44 assault rifles could be used to re-arm the whole squad , besides the machine-gun historically , a '' squad '' in the us army was a sub-unit of a section , consisting of from as few as two soldiers to as many as 12 and was originally used primarily for drill and administrative purposes ( e.g in 1891 , the us army officially defined a rifle '' squad '' as consisting of '' seven privates and one corporal ) the squad leader was still only a corporal but the squad was also assigned a pfc ( one of the scout riflemen ) as the assistant to the squad leader this adjustment raised the squad leader to a sergeant ( grade 4 ) and the assistant squad leader to a corporal ( grade 5 ) ” the second element was a three-man browning automatic rifle ( bar ) team consisting of an automatic rifleman , an assistant automatic rifleman and an ammunition bearer ” lastly , there were five riflemen and the assistant squad leader , who formed the “ maneuver element ” ( e.g ” in 1942 , the army had a massive restructuring of its tables of organization & equipment ( to & es ) and increased the rank of the squad leader and assistant squad leader to staff sergeant and sergeant , respectively ( platoon leaders now became technical sergeants , as grade 2 , and first sergeants became equal in pay grade to master sergeants as grade 1 ( in 1943 nco platoon leaders were re-designated as platoon sergeants and officer platoon commanders became platoon leaders 72–73 the squad leader was again called a sergeant ( but retained the grade 3 pay grade and insignia of the rank of a staff sergeant , which was then eliminated ( pfc became grade 5 , private was grade 6 , and recruit was grade 7 ; pfcs wore one chevron and privates and recruits both wore none ) the five riflemen of the “ charlie ” team , now led by the squad leader , remained as the maneuver element in 1951 the pay grades were reversed , with master sergeant becoming e-7 ( vice the previous grade 1 ) and sergeant first class becoming e-6 , so that the squad leader became a sergeant ( e-5 ) and the assistant squad leader , a corporal ( e-4 ) the rifle squad was reorganized into an eleven-man organization with a sergeant ( e-5 ) as squad leader and two five-man fire teams 91 each fire team consisted of a corporal ( e-4 ) team leader , an automatic rifleman , an assistant automatic rifleman , a grenadier , and a scout-rifleman in 1958 , with the addition of the e-8 and e-9 pay grades , the ranks of the squad and fire team leaders changed again , now to staff sergeant ( e-6 ) and sergeant ( e-5 ) , respectively ( platoon sergeant became a separate rank title , and along with sfc , became e-7 ; first sergeants and master sergeants became pay grade e-8 this iteration of the rifle squad retained the two fire teams but eliminated the two scouts ( one in each fire team ) , instead providing the squad leader with one extra rifleman , who could be used to reinforce either fire team or assist the squad leader as required an exception was in mechanized infantry units , where an additional rifleman ( increasing the squad to eleven members ) was assigned as the driver of the squad 's m113 armored personnel carrier ) currently , us army rifle squads consist of nine soldiers , organized under a squad leader into two four-man fire teams us army , fm 100-2-3 the soviet army : troops , organization and equipment , 4–3 a squad is led by an nco known as a squad leader in the military , a squad leader is a non-commissioned officer who leads a squad of typically 9 soldiers ( us army : squad leader and two fireteams of 4 men each ) or 13 marines ( us marine corps : squad leader and three fireteams of 4 men each ) in a rifle squad , or 3 to 8 men in a crew-served weapons squad in the united states army the to & e rank of a rifle squad leader is staff sergeant ( e-6 , or or-6 ) and in the united states marine corps the to rank is sergeant ( e-5 , or or-5 ) , though a corporal may also act as a squad leader in the absence of sufficient numbers of sergeants

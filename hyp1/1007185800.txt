during world war 2 the german wehrmacht infantry squad or gruppe was mainly a general purpose machine gun ( gpmg ) based unit the advantage of the general purpose machine gun concept was that it added greatly to the overall volume of fire that could be put out by a squad-sized unit an infantry gruppe consisted of ten men ; a non-commissioned officer or unteroffizier squad leader , deputy squad leader , a three-man machine gun team ( machine gunner , assistant gunner and ammunition carrier ) and five riflemen as personal small arms the squad leader was issued a rifle or as of around 1941 a submachine gun , the machine gunner and his assistant were issued pistols and the deputy squad leader , ammunition carrier and the riflemen were issued rifles two of the standard issue bolt-action karabiner 98k rifles in the squad could be replaced with semi-automatic gewehr 43 rifles and occasionally , stg-44 assault rifles could be used to re-arm the whole squad , besides the machine-gun historically , a '' squad '' in the us army was a sub-unit of a section , consisting of from as few as two soldiers to as many as 12 and was originally used primarily for drill and administrative purposes ( e.g in 1891 , the us army officially defined a rifle '' squad '' as consisting of '' seven privates and one corporal the us army employed the eight-man rifle squad through wwi and until the late 1930s under the square division organizational plan , in which sergeants continued to lead sections consisting of two squads under the triangular division organization plan in 1939 rifle squads were no longer organized into sections ) the squad leader was still only a corporal but the squad was also assigned a pfc ( one of the scout riflemen ) as the assistant to the squad leader this soldier could serve as either the squad leader 's messenger to the platoon commander or could be used to relay orders to other squad elements , as needed this adjustment raised the squad leader to a sergeant ( grade 4 ) and the assistant squad leader to a corporal ( grade 5 ) ( in 1920 the enlisted rank structure was simplified and seven grades were established ranging from master sergeant as grade 1 to private as grade 7 ; staff sergeant being one of the new rank titles then established by combining several intermediate sergeant grades ranking above section leaders but below the company first sergeant ) this squad organization included two men serving as reconnaissance who along with the squad leader , formed the security element ( i.e ” the second element was a three-man browning automatic rifle ( bar ) team consisting of an automatic rifleman , an assistant automatic rifleman and an ammunition bearer ) the bar man ( automatic rifleman ) and the senior rifleman of the charlie element became corporals ( grade 5 ) and de facto team leaders , even though not officially designated as such 72–73 the squad leader was again called a sergeant ( but retained the grade 3 pay grade and insignia of the rank of a staff sergeant , which was then eliminated ( pfc became grade 5 , private was grade 6 , and recruit was grade 7 ; pfcs wore one chevron and privates and recruits both wore none also , in 1948 , the rank title of the platoon sergeant changed from technical sergeant ( which was eliminated ) to sergeant first class ( sfc ) ( grade 2 ) and the rank title of first sergeant was again eliminated , being retained only as an occupational title for the senior nco of a company the assistant squad leader position was eliminated , with the senior fire team leader now filling this role as needed in 1958 , with the addition of the e-8 and e-9 pay grades , the ranks of the squad and fire team leaders changed again , now to staff sergeant ( e-6 ) and sergeant ( e-5 ) , respectively ( platoon sergeant became a separate rank title , and along with sfc , became e-7 ; first sergeants and master sergeants became pay grade e-8 ) currently , us army rifle squads consist of nine soldiers , organized under a squad leader into two four-man fire teams the squad leader is a staff sergeant ( e-6 ) and the two fire team leaders are sergeants ( e-5 ) unlike the road era mechanized infantry units , none of the vehicle crewman ( m2a3 – three , m1126 – two ) are counted as part of the nine-man rifle squad transported by the vehicles squads are also used in reconnaissance , light armored reconnaissance ( scout dismounts ) , combat engineer , law enforcement ( i.e in the soviet armed forces a motorised rifle squad was mounted in either a btr armoured personnel carrier or bmp infantry fighting vehicle , with the former being more numerous by the late 1980s in the military , a squad leader is a non-commissioned officer who leads a squad of typically 9 soldiers ( us army : squad leader and two fireteams of 4 men each ) or 13 marines ( us marine corps : squad leader and three fireteams of 4 men each ) in a rifle squad , or 3 to 8 men in a crew-served weapons squad german army : feldwebel or oberfeldwebel ( previously unteroffizier / unterfeldwebel ; until 1945 obergefreiter in the wehrmacht or ss-rottenführer in the waffen-ss ) israel defense forces : sergeant ( samál ) or staff sergeant ( samár ) norwegian army : sergeant ( noc is corporal and leads the light machine gun fire team of the squad )

early tiger iis proved unreliable , owing principally to leaking seals and gaskets , and an overburdened drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle 11 lack of crew training could amplify this problem ; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already on their way to the front the first five tiger iis delivered to the panzer lehr division broke down before they could be used in combat , and were destroyed to prevent capture jentz and doyle 1993 , p the introduction of modified seals , gaskets and drive train components , as well as improved driver training and sufficient maintenance improved the tank 's mechanical reliability statistics from 15 march 1945 show reliability rates of 59 percent for the tiger , almost equal to the 62 percent of the panzer iv and better than the 48 percent of the panther that were operational by this period notwithstanding its initial reliability problems , the tiger ii was remarkably agile for such a heavy vehicle the first combat use of the tiger ii was by the 1st company of the 503rd heavy panzer battalion ( s.h.pz.abt two were lost in combat , while the company commander 's tank became irrecoverably trapped after falling into a bomb crater created during operation goodwood on the eastern front , it was first used on 12 august 1944 by the 501st heavy panzer battalion ( s.h.pz.abt because these german tanks suffered ammunition explosions , which caused many crew fatalities , main gun rounds were no longer allowed to be stowed within the turret , reducing capacity to 68 up to fourteen tiger iis of the 501st were destroyed or captured in the area between 11 and 14 august to ambushes and flank attacks by both soviet t-34-85 and is-2 tanks , and isu-122 assault guns in inconvenient sandy terrain kurt knispel , the highest scoring tank ace of all time ( 162 enemy armoured fighting vehicles destroyed ) , also served with the 503rd , and was killed in action on 29 april 1945 in his tiger ii 503 ) claimed approximately 500 kills in the period from january to april 1945 on the eastern front for the loss of 45 tiger iis ( most of which were abandoned and destroyed by their own crews after mechanical breakdowns or for lack of fuel ) the heavy armour and powerful long-range gun gave the tiger ii an advantage against all opposing western allied and soviet tanks attempting to engage it from head on moreover , the main armament of the tiger ii was capable of knocking out any allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding , well beyond the effective range of allied tank guns it proved capable of passing completely through its '' colleague '' , a tiger ausf b 's turret at a range of 400 m the armour of one vehicle was tested by firing at it with shells between 100 and 152 & nbsp ; mm calibre as a result , even when shells did not penetrate the armour , there was often a large amount of spalling from the inside of the plates , which damaged the transmission and rendered the tank inoperable the firing test against the tiger b turret front , however , was conducted after removal of the gun and mantlet , and resulted in penetrations close to armour openings , such as vision slits and gun location the penetrations to the right gun opening were influenced by previous 100 & nbsp ; mm projectile penetration hits or armour damage the 100 mm bs-3 and 122 mm a-19 could also penetrate the weld joints of the front hull at ranges of 500–600 metres after 3–4 shots tiger ii with early production turret is on display the aim of the project is a complete tiger ii in running order a cosmetically restored tiger ii ( production turret ) hull number 280273 , built in october 1944 this tiger ii ( production turret ) was previously displayed in the thun tank museum , and is now on loan to the schweizerisches militärmuseum full ( september 2006 ) information about the pz.kpfw.tiger ausf.b '' tiger ii '' at panzerworld tiger ii at the armorsite pantiger , a redesigned tiger ( u.s

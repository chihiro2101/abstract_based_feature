early tiger iis proved unreliable , owing principally to leaking seals and gaskets , and an overburdened drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle 11 lack of crew training could amplify this problem ; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already on their way to the front 501 ) arrived on the eastern front with only eight out of 45 tanks operational ; these faults were mostly due to drive-train failures the first five tiger iis delivered to the panzer lehr division broke down before they could be used in combat , and were destroyed to prevent capture the introduction of modified seals , gaskets and drive train components , as well as improved driver training and sufficient maintenance improved the tank 's mechanical reliability statistics from 15 march 1945 show reliability rates of 59 percent for the tiger , almost equal to the 62 percent of the panzer iv and better than the 48 percent of the panther that were operational by this period notwithstanding its initial reliability problems , the tiger ii was remarkably agile for such a heavy vehicle the first combat use of the tiger ii was by the 1st company of the 503rd heavy panzer battalion ( s.h.pz.abt two were lost in combat , while the company commander 's tank became irrecoverably trapped after falling into a bomb crater created during operation goodwood on the eastern front , it was first used on 12 august 1944 by the 501st heavy panzer battalion ( s.h.pz.abt up to fourteen tiger iis of the 501st were destroyed or captured in the area between 11 and 14 august to ambushes and flank attacks by both soviet t-34-85 and is-2 tanks , and isu-122 assault guns in inconvenient sandy terrain the capture of three operational tiger iis allowed the soviets to conduct tests at kubinka and to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses sledgehammers : strengths and flaws of tiger tank battalions in world war ii kurt knispel , the highest scoring tank ace of all time ( 162 enemy armoured fighting vehicles destroyed ) , also served with the 503rd , and was killed in action on 29 april 1945 in his tiger ii the tiger ii was also used in significant numbers , distributed into four heavy panzer battalions , during the ardennes offensive ( also known as the battle of the bulge ) of december 1944 '' german tanks of world war ii '' on 12 january 1945 , a column of tiger iis among other tanks from 524th heavy panzer battalion were involved in a short-range engagement with t-34 85 tanks near the village of lisow , with the germans leaving behind 5 tiger iis , 7 tiger is and 5 panthers for the loss of 4 t-34 85 tanks burnt out the heavy armour and powerful long-range gun gave the tiger ii an advantage against all opposing western allied and soviet tanks attempting to engage it from head on this was especially true on the western front where , until the arrival of the few m26 pershings in 1945 and the few m4 sherman upgrades that were scattered around europe after d-day , as well as a few late churchill models , neither the british nor us forces brought heavy tanks into service the 8.8 cm kwk 43 gave positive results in penetration and accuracy , which were on par with the 122 & nbsp ; mm d-25t the 100 mm bs-3 and 122 mm a-19 could also penetrate the weld joints of the front hull at ranges of 500–600 metres after 3–4 shots believed to have carried turret number 123 , colonel michel aubry , the founder of the museum , decided to put 233 on the turret in honour of the tiger ii that destroyed his sherman tank at the end of the war unlike other captured german vehicles , this tiger ii was never used by the french army tiger ii with early production turret is on display tiger ii ( production turret ) with turret number 002 ( 502 ) captured at oględów by the red army a cosmetically restored tiger ii ( production turret ) hull number 280273 , built in october 1944 list of military vehicles of world war ii list of world war ii military vehicles of germany list of sd.kfz information about the pz.kpfw.tiger ausf.b '' tiger ii '' at panzerworld tiger ii at the armorsite pantiger , a redesigned tiger ( u.s

early tiger iis proved unreliable , owing principally to leaking seals and gaskets , and an overburdened drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle jentz and doyle 1993 , p 11 lack of crew training could amplify this problem ; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already on their way to the front the first five tiger iis delivered to the panzer lehr division broke down before they could be used in combat , and were destroyed to prevent capture jentz and doyle 1993 , p the introduction of modified seals , gaskets and drive train components , as well as improved driver training and sufficient maintenance improved the tank 's mechanical reliability jentz and doyle 1993 , p statistics from 15 march 1945 show reliability rates of 59 percent for the tiger , almost equal to the 62 percent of the panzer iv and better than the 48 percent of the panther that were operational by this period notwithstanding its initial reliability problems , the tiger ii was remarkably agile for such a heavy vehicle contemporary german records and testing results indicate that its tactical mobility was as good as or better than most german or allied tanks the first combat use of the tiger ii was by the 1st company of the 503rd heavy panzer battalion ( s.h.pz.abt two were lost in combat , while the company commander 's tank became irrecoverably trapped after falling into a bomb crater created during operation goodwood on the eastern front , it was first used on 12 august 1944 by the 501st heavy panzer battalion ( s.h.pz.abt because these german tanks suffered ammunition explosions , which caused many crew fatalities , main gun rounds were no longer allowed to be stowed within the turret , reducing capacity to 68 up to fourteen tiger iis of the 501st were destroyed or captured in the area between 11 and 14 august to ambushes and flank attacks by both soviet t-34-85 and is-2 tanks , and isu-122 assault guns in inconvenient sandy terrain the 503rd remained in the hungarian theater of operations for 166 days , during which it accounted for at least 121 soviet tanks , 244 anti-tank guns and artillery pieces , five aircraft and a train the tiger ii was also used in significant numbers , distributed into four heavy panzer battalions , during the ardennes offensive ( also known as the battle of the bulge ) of december 1944 at least 150 tiger iis were present , nearly a third of total production , and most were lost during the course of the offensive 503 ) claimed approximately 500 kills in the period from january to april 1945 on the eastern front for the loss of 45 tiger iis ( most of which were abandoned and destroyed by their own crews after mechanical breakdowns or for lack of fuel ) jentz and doyle , 1993 , pp 34–36 as a result of its thick frontal armour , flanking manoeuvres were most often used against the tiger ii to attempt a shot at the thinner side and rear armour , giving a tactical advantage to the tiger ii in most engagements during august 1944 , two tiger ausf b tanks were captured by the soviets near sandomierz , and were soon moved to the testing grounds at kubinka during the transfer , the two tanks suffered from various mechanical breakdowns ; the cooling system was insufficient for the excessively hot weather , where the engine tended to overheat and cause a consequential failure of the gearbox the 100 mm bs-3 and 122 mm a-19 could also penetrate the weld joints of the front hull at ranges of 500–600 metres after 3–4 shots this tiger ii 's engine was removed for use in the restoration of tiger 131 , the only working example of a tiger i a cosmetically restored tiger ii ( production turret ) hull number 280273 , built in october 1944 this tiger ii ( production turret ) was previously displayed in the thun tank museum , and is now on loan to the schweizerisches militärmuseum full ( september 2006 ) information about the pz.kpfw.tiger ausf.b '' tiger ii '' at panzerworld tiger ii at the armorsite pantiger , a redesigned tiger ( u.s

early tiger iis proved unreliable , owing principally to leaking seals and gaskets , and an overburdened drive train originally intended for a lighter vehicle jentz and doyle 1993 , p jentz and doyle 1993 , p 11 lack of crew training could amplify this problem ; drivers originally given only limited training on other tanks were often sent directly to operational units already on their way to the front the first five tiger iis delivered to the panzer lehr division broke down before they could be used in combat , and were destroyed to prevent capture jentz and doyle 1993 , p the introduction of modified seals , gaskets and drive train components , as well as improved driver training and sufficient maintenance improved the tank 's mechanical reliability statistics from 15 march 1945 show reliability rates of 59 percent for the tiger , almost equal to the 62 percent of the panzer iv and better than the 48 percent of the panther that were operational by this period notwithstanding its initial reliability problems , the tiger ii was remarkably agile for such a heavy vehicle contemporary german records and testing results indicate that its tactical mobility was as good as or better than most german or allied tanks jentz and doyle 1993 , pp the first combat use of the tiger ii was by the 1st company of the 503rd heavy panzer battalion ( s.h.pz.abt on the eastern front , it was first used on 12 august 1944 by the 501st heavy panzer battalion ( s.h.pz.abt the capture of three operational tiger iis allowed the soviets to conduct tests at kubinka and to evaluate its strengths and weaknesses sledgehammers : strengths and flaws of tiger tank battalions in world war ii the 503rd remained in the hungarian theater of operations for 166 days , during which it accounted for at least 121 soviet tanks , 244 anti-tank guns and artillery pieces , five aircraft and a train kurt knispel , the highest scoring tank ace of all time ( 162 enemy armoured fighting vehicles destroyed ) , also served with the 503rd , and was killed in action on 29 april 1945 in his tiger ii the tiger ii was also used in significant numbers , distributed into four heavy panzer battalions , during the ardennes offensive ( also known as the battle of the bulge ) of december 1944 at least 150 tiger iis were present , nearly a third of total production , and most were lost during the course of the offensive 503 ) claimed approximately 500 kills in the period from january to april 1945 on the eastern front for the loss of 45 tiger iis ( most of which were abandoned and destroyed by their own crews after mechanical breakdowns or for lack of fuel ) the heavy armour and powerful long-range gun gave the tiger ii an advantage against all opposing western allied and soviet tanks attempting to engage it from head on a wa pr√ºf 1 report estimated that the tiger ii 's frontal aspect was impervious to the 122 & nbsp ; mm d-25t , the largest calibre tank gun of ww2 however , soviet testing contradicted this as they found that the frontal glacis could be destroyed by firing 3-4 shots at the weld joints from the ranges of 500-600m which were found to be inferior in quality to that of previous german designs like the tiger i or panther moreover , the main armament of the tiger ii was capable of knocking out any allied tank frontally at ranges exceeding , well beyond the effective range of allied tank guns believed to have carried turret number 123 , colonel michel aubry , the founder of the museum , decided to put 233 on the turret in honour of the tiger ii that destroyed his sherman tank at the end of the war unlike other captured german vehicles , this tiger ii was never used by the french army tiger ii ( production turret ) information about the pz.kpfw.tiger ausf.b '' tiger ii '' at panzerworld tiger ii at the armorsite pantiger , a redesigned tiger ( u.s

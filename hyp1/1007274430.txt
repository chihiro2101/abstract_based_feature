rather than face steady demise as the new form of transport developed , a number of the proprietors formed the manchester & lincoln union railway company in october 1845 locally , this included a line from staveley to gainsborough , via worksop , with a branch to lincoln and another from worksop to beighton the previous year , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had been proposed , to build a line from sheffield to gainsborough , and was supported by the sheffield , ashton-under-lyne & manchester railway now arguing from a position of strength , the manchester & lincoln union rescinded their plans for most of their lines , and obtained an act of parliament on 7 august 1846 allowing them to construct a line from the midland railway at staveley to the canal at worksop the new company amalgamated with the chesterfield canal , to become the rather unwieldy manchester & lincoln union railway & chesterfield & gainsborough canal , with powers to further amalgamate with the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level under the new regime , the canal was put back into good order in 1848 , after many years where regular maintenance had been neglected however , the owners considered options for converting the canal from kiverton park to chesterfield into a railway in 1872 , 1873 and 1884 , but on each occasion , the plans were shelved the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway was expanding , and an act of parliament was obtained in 1889 , which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting chesterfield , staveley and beighton to be constructed the new route was straighter than the old , and reduced the length of the canal by around the beighton to staveley section of the new railway opened on 1 december 1891 , and reached chesterfield on 4 june 1892 the railway 's carrying business on this and other canals ceased shortly afterwards the original route of the canal at hague lane was largely destroyed by the construction of the railway and renishaw central station , but further north , the section around chapel wheel forge and dam is still clearly visible , and reinstatement of it as part of a restored canal was considered but rejected on practical grounds close to bluebank lock , the railway , known as the great central railway chesterfield loop , turned to the east and passed to the south of staveley iron works to reach staveley town station prior to construction of this section , the canal looped to the north around the iron works , passing through cinderhill lock before turning south-eastwards some 40 boats were still working on the canal , although a short section between staveley and chesterfield had become unnavigable responsibility for the canal passed the london and north eastern railway ( lner ) in 1923 , who carried out regular maintenance , and repaired and enlarged the lock connecting west stockwith basin to the river trent between 1923 and 1925 the british transport commission agreed to keep the canal open for two more years in 1962 , although the lockgates from worksop to kiveton were removed , and the lock walls bulldozed , on the grounds of public safety clarke formed the retford and worksop ( chesterfield canal ) boat club soon afterwards , and it became a limited company in 1966 , to cope with the growing membership such activity became slightly more collaborative when the canal became the responsibility of the british waterways board the chesterfield canal trust was formed in september 1976 , determined to restore the canal beyond worksop , and in 1977 they organised a boat rally at worksop to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the canal , in conjunction with the worksop and retford boat club progress beyond worksop moved forwards rapidly in 1995 , when a derelict land grant was obtained by nottinghamshire county council , and with additional funding from british coal , a Â£4.5 million scheme began to restore the canal between worksop and the aqueduct over the river ryton which forms the county boundary three bridges had been rebuilt with navigable headroom , one over tylden road , the main access road into rhodesia , an adjacent one that provided access to nearby cottages , and one which carried shireoaks common over the canal near to shireoaks railway station however , in practice progress had been slow , and attention turned to the section west of norwood tunnel , where much more damage had been done to the canal bed , with it being filled in and built over in many places the work was aided by a road-building scheme for a new staveley bypass , which enabled two bridges to be raised and a third to be built , all with sufficient clearance for navigation although the track on the mineral line has been removed , its route may be reused to provide access to a maintenance depot , for the high speed 2 ( hs2 ) railway project the chesterfield canal partnership , an association of local and regional authorities , including the chesterfield canal trust and other interested parties , have produced detailed plans for all of the work required to reinstate the missing section this would provide a way to reach the chesterfield canal without negotiating the tidal river trent , and would create a new cruising ring , taking in the rother link , river don navigation , stainforth and keadby canal , river trent , and chesterfield canal later that day , it was noticed that a whirlpool had formed and it became evident that the section of the canal between whitsunday pie lock and retford town lock was losing water list of waterway societies in the united kingdom list of canal tunnels in the united kingdom list of canal locks in the united kingdom adelphi canal derby canal

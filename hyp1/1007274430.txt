locally , this included a line from staveley to gainsborough , via worksop , with a branch to lincoln and another from worksop to beighton the previous year , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had been proposed , to build a line from sheffield to gainsborough , and was supported by the sheffield , ashton-under-lyne & manchester railway the new scheme was in direct competition to the earlier one , but the two sets of proprietors met and agreed to amalgamate now arguing from a position of strength , the manchester & lincoln union rescinded their plans for most of their lines , and obtained an act of parliament on 7 august 1846 allowing them to construct a line from the midland railway at staveley to the canal at worksop the new company amalgamated with the chesterfield canal , to become the rather unwieldy manchester & lincoln union railway & chesterfield & gainsborough canal , with powers to further amalgamate with the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway however , by the time they announced this , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had already become part of the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway , and so they amalgamated with that company instead the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level the railway company started to operate as a carrier on the canal , and to maintain water levels , the reservoirs at chesterfield were enlarged in 1856 the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway was expanding , and an act of parliament was obtained in 1889 , which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting chesterfield , staveley and beighton to be constructed the new route was straighter than the old , and reduced the length of the canal by around the beighton to staveley section of the new railway opened on 1 december 1891 , and reached chesterfield on 4 june 1892 close to bluebank lock , the railway , known as the great central railway chesterfield loop , turned to the east and passed to the south of staveley iron works to reach staveley town station prior to construction of this section , the canal looped to the north around the iron works , passing through cinderhill lock before turning south-eastwards the canal was re-routed along the southern edge of the works , and the railway crossed over at staveley works station , almost on top of a new lock which was known as staveley works lock or hollingwood lock left following the post-war labour government nationalisation of the railways and the canals , the chesterfield canal became the responsibility of the british transport commission the british transport commission agreed to keep the canal open for two more years in 1962 , although the lockgates from worksop to kiveton were removed , and the lock walls bulldozed , on the grounds of public safety by 1968 , restoration efforts were sufficiently organised that the chesterfield canal was mentioned in the may edition of the bulletin , produced for members of the inland waterways association ( iwa ) by the forerunners of the waterway recovery group progress beyond worksop moved forwards rapidly in 1995 , when a derelict land grant was obtained by nottinghamshire county council , and with additional funding from british coal , a £4.5 million scheme began to restore the canal between worksop and the aqueduct over the river ryton which forms the county boundary the complete project cost £19 million , which included an extra £971,000 received from the heritage lottery fund , to allow detailed archaeological investigation of the thorpe and turnerwood lock flights to be undertaken however , in practice progress had been slow , and attention turned to the section west of norwood tunnel , where much more damage had been done to the canal bed , with it being filled in and built over in many places however , parts of the channel had survived remarkably well in places , as it had been used to supply water to the iron industry , and maintained by a team with a boat until the 1950s the last few miles of the canal , from chesterfield to staveley , were in reasonable condition , although the towpath was overgrown and difficult to access , while much of the route was under threat from opencast coal mining and a planned bypass , which had first been proposed in 1927 in a separate development , a private owner of a length of the canal near boiley farm , killamarsh , obtained a derelict land grant to enable him to restore around of the channel in 1992 although used as fishing ponds , the work resulted in a navigable profile being re-established , and a water supply was obtained from a small unnamed brook , which feeds into the southern end of the ponds a breach in the canal in march 2007 , caused by the collapse of a culvert carrying the tinkersick brook under the canal , forced temporary closure of all but the top pound above tapton lock for about six weeks near the site of the former renishaw iron foundry , which closed in 1992 and was subsequently redeveloped for housing , a length of canal was reexcavated in 2007–08 the work included the new renishaw foundry footbridge ( 18a ) , which connects the housing to green space and a play area on the bank of the canal , and deep piling where an embankment originally carried the canal over the smithy brook the solution adopted to overcome this was the construction of a dropped pound , with a new staveley town lock ( 5a ) immediately to the north of staveley basin to lower the level of the canal , and railway lock ( 5b ) constructed just beyond the railway bridge norwood tunnel was a , and ,

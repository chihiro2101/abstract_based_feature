rather than face steady demise as the new form of transport developed , a number of the proprietors formed the manchester & lincoln union railway company in october 1845 the intention was to build a line from liverpool to grimsby , and to convert part of the canal into a railway locally , this included a line from staveley to gainsborough , via worksop , with a branch to lincoln and another from worksop to beighton the previous year , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had been proposed , to build a line from sheffield to gainsborough , and was supported by the sheffield , ashton-under-lyne & manchester railway the new company amalgamated with the chesterfield canal , to become the rather unwieldy manchester & lincoln union railway & chesterfield & gainsborough canal , with powers to further amalgamate with the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway however , by the time they announced this , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had already become part of the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway , and so they amalgamated with that company instead the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level however , the owners considered options for converting the canal from kiverton park to chesterfield into a railway in 1872 , 1873 and 1884 , but on each occasion , the plans were shelved the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway was expanding , and an act of parliament was obtained in 1889 , which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting chesterfield , staveley and beighton to be constructed the new route was straighter than the old , and reduced the length of the canal by around the original route of the canal at hague lane was largely destroyed by the construction of the railway and renishaw central station , but further north , the section around chapel wheel forge and dam is still clearly visible , and reinstatement of it as part of a restored canal was considered but rejected on practical grounds close to bluebank lock , the railway , known as the great central railway chesterfield loop , turned to the east and passed to the south of staveley iron works to reach staveley town station prior to construction of this section , the canal looped to the north around the iron works , passing through cinderhill lock before turning south-eastwards some 40 boats were still working on the canal , although a short section between staveley and chesterfield had become unnavigable the canal was making a loss , with receipts of £1,837 and expenditure of £3,883 in 1905 the largest drain on resources was the norwood tunnel , where £21,000 had been spent since 1871 , in an attempt to repair damage and raise the roof responsibility for the canal passed the london and north eastern railway ( lner ) in 1923 , who carried out regular maintenance , and repaired and enlarged the lock connecting west stockwith basin to the river trent between 1923 and 1925 the british transport commission agreed to keep the canal open for two more years in 1962 , although the lockgates from worksop to kiveton were removed , and the lock walls bulldozed , on the grounds of public safety government policy changed following the publication of a white paper entitled british waterways : recreation and amenity in september 1967 , and the canal was classified as a cruiseway between the trent and morse lock , worksop under the transport act 1968 , meaning that it would be maintained to a navigable standard for leisure use by 1968 , restoration efforts were sufficiently organised that the chesterfield canal was mentioned in the may edition of the bulletin , produced for members of the inland waterways association ( iwa ) by the forerunners of the waterway recovery group the duke of devonshire opened the festivities , and the chesterfield canal society was formally launched , with a view to attracting support from anyone interested in the canal , rather than just from boaters progress beyond worksop moved forwards rapidly in 1995 , when a derelict land grant was obtained by nottinghamshire county council , and with additional funding from british coal , a £4.5 million scheme began to restore the canal between worksop and the aqueduct over the river ryton which forms the county boundary however , in practice progress had been slow , and attention turned to the section west of norwood tunnel , where much more damage had been done to the canal bed , with it being filled in and built over in many places in a separate development , a private owner of a length of the canal near boiley farm , killamarsh , obtained a derelict land grant to enable him to restore around of the channel in 1992 in 1997 , the chesterfield canal trust was formed , as a limited company with charitable aims , and took over the assets of the canal society in 1998 the work included the new renishaw foundry footbridge ( 18a ) , which connects the housing to green space and a play area on the bank of the canal , and deep piling where an embankment originally carried the canal over the smithy brook the work was aided by a road-building scheme for a new staveley bypass , which enabled two bridges to be raised and a third to be built , all with sufficient clearance for navigation norwood tunnel was a , and , brick-lined canal tunnel on the line of the chesterfield canal with its western portal in norwood , derbyshire and its eastern portal in kiveton , south yorkshire the towpath of the canal has become a long-distance footpath and cycle route , stretching for from chesterfield to west stockwith , and is signposted as the '' cuckoo way '' after the name given to the boats which worked on the canal list of waterway societies in the united kingdom list of canal tunnels in the united kingdom list of canal locks in the united

the intention was to build a line from liverpool to grimsby , and to convert part of the canal into a railway locally , this included a line from staveley to gainsborough , via worksop , with a branch to lincoln and another from worksop to beighton the previous year , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had been proposed , to build a line from sheffield to gainsborough , and was supported by the sheffield , ashton-under-lyne & manchester railway the new company amalgamated with the chesterfield canal , to become the rather unwieldy manchester & lincoln union railway & chesterfield & gainsborough canal , with powers to further amalgamate with the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway however , by the time they announced this , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had already become part of the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway , and so they amalgamated with that company instead the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level under the new regime , the canal was put back into good order in 1848 , after many years where regular maintenance had been neglected the railway company started to operate as a carrier on the canal , and to maintain water levels , the reservoirs at chesterfield were enlarged in 1856 however , the owners considered options for converting the canal from kiverton park to chesterfield into a railway in 1872 , 1873 and 1884 , but on each occasion , the plans were shelved the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway was expanding , and an act of parliament was obtained in 1889 , which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting chesterfield , staveley and beighton to be constructed close to bluebank lock , the railway , known as the great central railway chesterfield loop , turned to the east and passed to the south of staveley iron works to reach staveley town station responsibility for the canal passed the london and north eastern railway ( lner ) in 1923 , who carried out regular maintenance , and repaired and enlarged the lock connecting west stockwith basin to the river trent between 1923 and 1925 various attempts to reduce the growth of weed , which had first appeared on the canal in 1852 , were made , with variable success , and there was a brisk trade in munitions during the second world war the last serious commercial traffic on the canal was the carriage of bricks from walkeringham to west stockwith , which ended in 1955 , although there was a small trade in warp , a fine silt dredged from the trent at the mouth of the river idle , and used by the cutlery trade in sheffield for polishing metal , which lasted into the early 1960s left following the post-war labour government nationalisation of the railways and the canals , the chesterfield canal became the responsibility of the british transport commission by 1968 , restoration efforts were sufficiently organised that the chesterfield canal was mentioned in the may edition of the bulletin , produced for members of the inland waterways association ( iwa ) by the forerunners of the waterway recovery group the chesterfield canal trust was formed in september 1976 , determined to restore the canal beyond worksop , and in 1977 they organised a boat rally at worksop to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the canal , in conjunction with the worksop and retford boat club the duke of devonshire opened the festivities , and the chesterfield canal society was formally launched , with a view to attracting support from anyone interested in the canal , rather than just from boaters thirty locks had been restored , from morse lock ( 49 ) near worksop to thorpe top treble lock ( 20 ) near thorpe salvin three bridges had been rebuilt with navigable headroom , one over tylden road , the main access road into rhodesia , an adjacent one that provided access to nearby cottages , and one which carried shireoaks common over the canal near to shireoaks railway station however , in practice progress had been slow , and attention turned to the section west of norwood tunnel , where much more damage had been done to the canal bed , with it being filled in and built over in many places however , parts of the channel had survived remarkably well in places , as it had been used to supply water to the iron industry , and maintained by a team with a boat until the 1950s a campaign to ensure that once all the coal had been extracted from the opencast mine , the canal would be reinstated was successful although used as fishing ponds , the work resulted in a navigable profile being re-established , and a water supply was obtained from a small unnamed brook , which feeds into the southern end of the ponds near the site of the former renishaw iron foundry , which closed in 1992 and was subsequently redeveloped for housing , a length of canal was reexcavated in 2007–08 the next big advance was the opening of some of canal beyond mill green bridge , and the construction of a new mooring basin at staveley , which was completed in early 2012 with the canal open from west stockwith to the eastern portal of norwood tunnel , and from chesterfield to staveley , there were less than left to be restored by 2017 what are often called '' traditional '' working narrowboats were the product of the main canal system – but the craft that plied the 46 miles between chesterfield , retford , and the river trent were very different norwood tunnel was a , and , brick-lined canal tunnel on the line of the chesterfield canal with its western portal in norwood , derbyshire and its eastern portal in kiveton , south yorkshire drakeholes tunnel is a second , shorter tunnel 154 yards long also without a towpath built for the chesterfield canal at drakeholes , nottinghamshire a location between the norwood tunnel and the river trent

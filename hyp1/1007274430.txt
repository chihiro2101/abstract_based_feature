in the 1840s , railway mania was gripping the country , with many speculative schemes being proposed rather than face steady demise as the new form of transport developed , a number of the proprietors formed the manchester & lincoln union railway company in october 1845 the intention was to build a line from liverpool to grimsby , and to convert part of the canal into a railway locally , this included a line from staveley to gainsborough , via worksop , with a branch to lincoln and another from worksop to beighton the previous year , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had been proposed , to build a line from sheffield to gainsborough , and was supported by the sheffield , ashton-under-lyne & manchester railway now arguing from a position of strength , the manchester & lincoln union rescinded their plans for most of their lines , and obtained an act of parliament on 7 august 1846 allowing them to construct a line from the midland railway at staveley to the canal at worksop the new company amalgamated with the chesterfield canal , to become the rather unwieldy manchester & lincoln union railway & chesterfield & gainsborough canal , with powers to further amalgamate with the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway however , by the time they announced this , the sheffield & lincolnshire junction railway had already become part of the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway , and so they amalgamated with that company instead the act of parliament stated that although the canal company was to be dissolved , the entire canal was to be retained , its water supplies maintained , and tolls were to be fixed at a just level under the new regime , the canal was put back into good order in 1848 , after many years where regular maintenance had been neglected the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway was expanding , and an act of parliament was obtained in 1889 , which allowed them to divert parts of the canal to enable a new railway connecting chesterfield , staveley and beighton to be constructed the beighton to staveley section of the new railway opened on 1 december 1891 , and reached chesterfield on 4 june 1892 close to bluebank lock , the railway , known as the great central railway chesterfield loop , turned to the east and passed to the south of staveley iron works to reach staveley town station parts of the canal above worksop were affected by subsidence from local coal mines some 40 boats were still working on the canal , although a short section between staveley and chesterfield had become unnavigable left following the post-war labour government nationalisation of the railways and the canals , the chesterfield canal became the responsibility of the british transport commission the duke of devonshire opened the festivities , and the chesterfield canal society was formally launched , with a view to attracting support from anyone interested in the canal , rather than just from boaters regular workparties began the process of restoration in 1988 , organised by the chesterfield canal society , and supplemented by volunteers from the waterway recovery group periodically derbyshire county council acquired the section of canal between chesterfield and staveley and secured derelict land grants to enable dredging and towpath maintenance to take place a campaign to ensure that once all the coal had been extracted from the opencast mine , the canal would be reinstated was successful in a separate development , a private owner of a length of the canal near boiley farm , killamarsh , obtained a derelict land grant to enable him to restore around of the channel in 1992 near the site of the former renishaw iron foundry , which closed in 1992 and was subsequently redeveloped for housing , a length of canal was reexcavated in 2007â€“08 the work included the new renishaw foundry footbridge ( 18a ) , which connects the housing to green space and a play area on the bank of the canal , and deep piling where an embankment originally carried the canal over the smithy brook the next big advance was the opening of some of canal beyond mill green bridge , and the construction of a new mooring basin at staveley , which was completed in early 2012 the first bridge over the canal in this location was further to the east , and was erected in the 1850s , when the canal arm to speedwell colliery was filled in , to be converted to a railway the staveley ironworks railway system was sold to the midland railway in the 1870s , who built a replacement line and bridge , to ease the sharpness of the curve with the canal open from west stockwith to the eastern portal of norwood tunnel , and from chesterfield to staveley , there were less than left to be restored by 2017 norwood tunnel was a , and , brick-lined canal tunnel on the line of the chesterfield canal with its western portal in norwood , derbyshire and its eastern portal in kiveton , south yorkshire hollingwood common tunnel is a disused navigable coalmine adit which terminated at the chesterfield canal near staveley however , these plugs were a common feature of english canals built at that time and other instances of sudden drainage ( both purposeful and accidental ) have since been recorded , including emptying of the pontcysyllte aqueduct on the llangollen canal

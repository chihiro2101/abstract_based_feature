non-associative learning refers to '' a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus non-associative learning can be divided into habituation and sensitization habituation is an example of non-associative learning in which one or more components of an innate response ( e.g , response probability , response duration ) to a stimulus diminishes when the stimulus is repeated in operant extinction , for example , a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward an example of habituation can be seen in small song birds—if a stuffed owl ( or similar predator ) is put into the cage , the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator the habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli , respectively sensitization is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a stimulus ( bell et al this is based on the notion that a defensive reflex to a stimulus such as withdrawal or escape becomes stronger after the exposure to a different harmful or threatening stimulus an everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously active learning occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience since understanding information is the key aspect of learning , it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not studies within metacognition have proven the value in active learning , claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result bransford , 2000 , pp 15–20 in addition , learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn active learning is a key characteristic of student-centered learning in classical conditioning a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a reflex eliciting stimulus until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own in operant conditioning , a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus following conditioning , the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other , unrelated stimulus ( now referred to as the '' conditioned stimulus '' ) the response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a conditioned response once this occurred , the bell became the conditioned stimulus ( cs ) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response ( cr ) watson 's behaviorism ( and philosophy of science ) stood in direct contrast to freud and other accounts based largely on introspection in 1913 , watson published the article '' psychology as the behaviorist views , '' in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science observational learning is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others it is a form of social learning which takes various forms , based on various processes in humans , this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur , but instead , requires a social model such as a parent , sibling , friend , or teacher with surroundings in filial imprinting , young animals , particularly birds , form an association with another individual or in some cases , an object , that they respond to as they would to a parent in 1935 , the austrian zoologist konrad lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds cats are known to play with a ball of string when young , which gives them experience with catching prey play involves a significant cost to animals , such as increased vulnerability to predators and the risk of injury and possibly infection it also consumes energy , so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved play , as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child 's learning and development children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger , through play activities as a form of learning , play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children children learn to think creatively when they learn through play specific activities involved in each type of play change over time as humans progress through the lifespan enculturation is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture chillihuani girls in peru described themselves as weaving constantly , following behavior shown by the other adults episodic learning is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event learning and memory : basic principles , processes , and procedures for example , a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is episodic learning episodic learning is so named because events are recorded into episodic memory , which is one of the three forms of explicit learning and retrieval , along with perceptual memory and semantic memory he would use semantic memory to answer someone who would ask him information such as where the grand canyon is by personalizing instruction , augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime augmented learning , augmented learning : context-aware mobile augmented reality architecture for learning see also minimally invasive education moore ( 1989 ) purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality , effective online learning : learner–learner ( i.e student-teacher communication ) , and learner–content ( i.e rote learning is memorizing information so that it can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard the major technique used for rote learning is learning by repetition , based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly ( but not its meaning ) if the information is repeatedly processed rote learning is used in diverse areas , from mathematics to music to religion to this end , meaningful learning contrasts with rote learning in which information is acquired without regard to understanding meaningful learning , on the other hand , implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned evidence-based learning methods such as spaced repetition can increase the rate at which a student learns london , england : department for education and employment , august 1999 nonformal learning is organized learning outside the formal learning system informal learning is less structured than '' nonformal '' one it is learning from life , during a meal at the table with parents , play , exploring , etc the un and eu recognize these different forms of learning ( cf to learn a skill , such as solving a rubik 's cube quickly , several factors come into play at once : reading directions helps a player learn the patterns that solve the rubik 's cube revisiting the cube occasionally helps retain the skill tangential learning self-education can be improved with systematization according to experts in natural learning , self-oriented learning training has proven an effective tool for assisting independent learners with the natural phases of learning points out that intrinsic integration of learning content seems to be a crucial design factor , and that games that include modules for further self-studies tend to present good results incidental learning is an occurrence that is not generally accounted for using the traditional methods of instructional objectives and outcomes assessment research implies that some un-assessed aspects of onsite and online learning challenge the equivalency of education between the two modalities first is learning—in which an animal gathers information about its environment and uses this information because there is no need for learning in this scenario—and because learning could prove disadvantageous due to the time it took to learn the information—non-learning evolves a direction for future research is testing whether circadian rhythms in plants modulate learning and behavior and surveying researchers ' definitions of “ cognition ” and “ learning

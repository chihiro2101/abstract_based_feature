non-associative learning refers to '' a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus non-associative learning can be divided into habituation and sensitization habituation is an example of non-associative learning in which one or more components of an innate response ( e.g , response probability , response duration ) to a stimulus diminishes when the stimulus is repeated the habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli , respectively sensitization is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a stimulus ( bell et al an everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously the pain results from the progressively amplified synaptic response of the peripheral nerves warning that the stimulation is harmful sensitization is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism active learning occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience since understanding information is the key aspect of learning , it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings studies within metacognition have proven the value in active learning , claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result 15–20 in addition , learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn active learning is a key characteristic of student-centered learning conversely , passive learning and direct instruction are characteristics of teacher-centered learning ( or traditional education ) stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications following conditioning , the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other , unrelated stimulus ( now referred to as the '' conditioned stimulus '' ) the response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a conditioned response the classic example is ivan pavlov and his dogs meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus ( us ) and the salivation is the unconditioned response ( ur ) pavlov rang a bell before presenting the meat powder after numerous pairings of bell and food , the dogs learned that the bell signaled that food was about to come , and began to salivate when they heard the bell it was recently also demonstrated in garden pea plants watson 's work was very influential and paved the way for b.f watson 's view was that the introspective method was too subjective and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors play generally describes behavior with no particular end in itself , but that improves performance in similar future situations this is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans , but is mostly limited to mammals and birds it also consumes energy , so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved play is generally seen in younger animals , suggesting a link with learning play , as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child 's learning and development through play , children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger , through play activities as a form of learning , play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children all types of play generate thinking and problem-solving skills in children children learn to think creatively when they learn through play enculturation is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture episodic learning is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event for example , a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is episodic learning for instance , if a person remembers the grand canyon from a recent visit , it is an episodic memory e-learning and augmented learning electronic learning or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning a specific and always more diffused e-learning is mobile learning ( m-learning ) , which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment , such as cellular phones by adapting to the needs of individuals , the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner 's natural environment augmented digital content may include text , images , video , audio ( music and voice ) augmented learning , augmented learning : context-aware mobile augmented reality architecture for learning see also minimally invasive education moore ( 1989 ) purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality , effective online learning : learner–learner ( i.e in his theory of transactional distance , moore ( 1993 ) moore , m.g ) , theoretical principles of distance education ( pp rote learning is used in diverse areas , from mathematics to music to religion although it has been criticized by some educators , rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning meaningful learning is the concept that learned knowledge ( e.g , a fact ) is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge to this end , meaningful learning contrasts with rote learning in which information is acquired without regard to understanding evidence-based learning methods such as spaced repetition can increase the rate at which a student learns the term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning , but rather the way it is directed and organized in formal learning , the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning nonformal learning is organized learning outside the formal learning system informal learning is less structured than '' nonformal '' one the educational system may use a combination of formal , informal , and nonformal learning methods in some schools , students can get points that count in the formal-learning systems if they get work done in informal-learning circuits tangential learning is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy extra credits writer and game designer james portnow was the first to suggest games as a potential venue for '' tangential learning '' a significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur heredity governs or conditions our ability to learn and the rate of learning the attitude of the student must be tested to find out how much inclination he or she has for learning a subject or topic learning activities : learning depends upon the activities and experiences provided by the teacher , his concept of discipline , methods of teaching , and above all his overall personality the concepts of learning and memory are relevant in identifying how plants respond to external cues , a behavior necessary for survival

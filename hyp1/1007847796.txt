non-associative learning refers to '' a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus '' this definition exempt the changes caused by sensory adaptation , fatigue , or injury non-associative learning can be divided into habituation and sensitization habituation is an example of non-associative learning in which one or more components of an innate response ( e.g , response probability , response duration ) to a stimulus diminishes when the stimulus is repeated thus , habituation must be distinguished from extinction , which is an associative process sensitization is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a stimulus ( bell et al an everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously sensitization is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism active learning occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings 15–20 in addition , learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn active learning is a key characteristic of student-centered learning conversely , passive learning and direct instruction are characteristics of teacher-centered learning ( or traditional education ) associative learning is the process by which a person or animal learns an association between two stimuli or events in classical conditioning a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a reflex eliciting stimulus until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own in operant conditioning , a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus in operant conditioning , a reinforcement ( by reward ) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior , changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications following conditioning , the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other , unrelated stimulus ( now referred to as the '' conditioned stimulus '' ) pavlov fed his dogs meat powder , which naturally made the dogs salivate—salivating is a reflexive response to the meat powder the first time pavlov rang the bell , the neutral stimulus , the dogs did not salivate , but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate once this occurred , the bell became the conditioned stimulus ( cs ) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response ( cr ) another influential person in the world of classical conditioning is john b skinner 's radical behaviorism in 1913 , watson published the article '' psychology as the behaviorist views , '' in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science watson 's most famous , and controversial , experiment was '' little albert '' , where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles observational learning is learning that occurs through observing the behavior of others it is a form of social learning which takes various forms , based on various processes imprinting is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior this is seen in a wide variety of vertebrates besides humans , but is mostly limited to mammals and birds besides inanimate objects , animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals , such as orcas playing with seals they have caught play involves a significant cost to animals , such as increased vulnerability to predators and the risk of injury and possibly infection play is generally seen in younger animals , suggesting a link with learning however , it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning , for example improving physical fitness children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger , through play activities children and play in early childhood education : an exciting challenge children learn to think creatively when they learn through play play as a form of learning , can occur solitarily , or involve interacting with others enculturation is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture '' handbook of socialization : theory and research '' , 2007 , guilford press ; ; at p this is different from acculturation , where a person adopts the values and societal rules of a culture different from their native one collaborative practices in the mazahua people have shown that participation in everyday interaction and later learning activities contributed to enculturation rooted in nonverbal social experience he would use semantic memory to answer someone who would ask him information such as where the grand canyon is a study revealed that humans are very accurate in the recognition of episodic memory even without deliberate intention to memorize it multimedia learning is where a person uses both auditory and visual stimuli to learn information this type of learning relies on dual-coding theory electronic learning or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning by personalizing instruction , augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime moore ( 1989 ) purported that three core types of interaction are necessary for quality , effective online learning : learner–learner ( i.e rote learning is memorizing information so that it can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard the major technique used for rote learning is learning by repetition , based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly ( but not its meaning ) if the information is repeatedly processed the term formal learning has nothing to do with the formality of the learning , but rather the way it is directed and organized in formal learning , the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning , '' informal learning in the workplace '' , department for education and employment research report no for example , learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints , in clubs or in ( international ) youth organizations , workshops nonformal learning and combined approaches tangential learning is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy points out that intrinsic integration of learning content seems to be a crucial design factor , and that games that include modules for further self-studies tend to present good results the importance of rules that regulate learning modules and game experience is discussed by moreno , c if the child points or walks towards the cabinet , the instructor prompts the student to say “ train an instructor waits for the student to initiate engagement an instructor allows access to an item/activity contingent on a correct response from the student additional research is called for to investigate the implications of these findings both conceptually and pedagogically psychomotor : to dance , swim , ski , dive , drive a car , ride a bike , etc a significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur therefore , different scenarios better suit either learning or innate knowledge however , if an environment is in a constant state of change , then learning is disadvantageous

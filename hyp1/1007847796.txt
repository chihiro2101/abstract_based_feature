non-associative learning refers to '' a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus non-associative learning can be divided into habituation and sensitization habituation is an example of non-associative learning in which one or more components of an innate response ( e.g , response probability , response duration ) to a stimulus diminishes when the stimulus is repeated thus , habituation must be distinguished from extinction , which is an associative process in operant extinction , for example , a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward the habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli , respectively habituation has been shown in essentially every species of animal , as well as the sensitive plant mimosa pudica and the large protozoan stentor coeruleus sensitization is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a stimulus ( bell et al this is based on the notion that a defensive reflex to a stimulus such as withdrawal or escape becomes stronger after the exposure to a different harmful or threatening stimulus the pain results from the progressively amplified synaptic response of the peripheral nerves warning that the stimulation is harmful sensitization is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism active learning occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience since understanding information is the key aspect of learning , it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings studies within metacognition have proven the value in active learning , claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result 15–20 in addition , learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn active learning is a key characteristic of student-centered learning conversely , passive learning and direct instruction are characteristics of teacher-centered learning ( or traditional education ) in classical conditioning a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a reflex eliciting stimulus until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own in operant conditioning , a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications following conditioning , the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other , unrelated stimulus ( now referred to as the '' conditioned stimulus '' ) the classic example is ivan pavlov and his dogs meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus ( us ) and the salivation is the unconditioned response ( ur ) another influential person in the world of classical conditioning is john b watson 's behaviorism ( and philosophy of science ) stood in direct contrast to freud and other accounts based largely on introspection watson 's view was that the introspective method was too subjective and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors in 1913 , watson published the article '' psychology as the behaviorist views , '' in which he argued that laboratory studies should serve psychology best as a science watson 's most famous , and controversial , experiment was '' little albert '' , where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles it is a form of social learning which takes various forms , based on various processes in humans , this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur , but instead , requires a social model such as a parent , sibling , friend , or teacher with surroundings in filial imprinting , young animals , particularly birds , form an association with another individual or in some cases , an object , that they respond to as they would to a parent play involves a significant cost to animals , such as increased vulnerability to predators and the risk of injury and possibly infection play , as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child 's learning and development through play , children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration children develop emotional skills such as learning to deal with the emotion of anger , through play activities children and play in early childhood education : an exciting challenge children learn to think creatively when they learn through play play as a form of learning , can occur solitarily , or involve interacting with others if successful , enculturation results in competence in the language , values , and rituals of the culture the collaborative and helpful behaviors exhibited by mexican and mexican-heritage children is a cultural practice known as being '' acomedido '' episodic learning is a change in behavior that occurs as a result of an event learning and memory : basic principles , processes , and procedures for example , a fear of dogs that follows being bitten by a dog is episodic learning episodic learning is so named because events are recorded into episodic memory , which is one of the three forms of explicit learning and retrieval , along with perceptual memory and semantic memory for instance , if a person remembers the grand canyon from a recent visit , it is an episodic memory he would use semantic memory to answer someone who would ask him information such as where the grand canyon is multimedia learning is where a person uses both auditory and visual stimuli to learn information electronic learning or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning when a learner interacts with the e-learning environment , it 's called augmented learning augmented learning , augmented learning : context-aware mobile augmented reality architecture for learning see also minimally invasive education student-teacher communication ) , and learner–content ( i.e rote learning is used in diverse areas , from mathematics to music to religion although it has been criticized by some educators , rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning to this end , meaningful learning contrasts with rote learning in which information is acquired without regard to understanding in formal learning , the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning nonformal learning is organized learning outside the formal learning system informal learning is less structured than '' nonformal '' one nonformal learning and combined approaches practicing the moves repeatedly helps build '' muscle memory '' and speed thinking critically about moves helps find shortcuts , which speeds future attempts tangential learning self-education can be improved with systematization points out that intrinsic integration of learning content seems to be a crucial design factor , and that games that include modules for further self-studies tend to present good results a significant and long research history has also attempted to explicate the conditions under which transfer of learning might occur heredity : a classroom instructor can neither change nor increase heredity , but the student can use and develop it physical environment : the design , quality , and setting of a learning space , such as a school or classroom , can each be critical to the success of a learning environment for example , a machine learning system could be trained on email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam

non-associative learning can be divided into habituation and sensitization habituation is an example of non-associative learning in which one or more components of an innate response ( e.g in operant extinction , for example , a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward soon the birds react less , showing habituation sensitization is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a stimulus ( bell et al an everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously after a while , this stimulation creates a warm sensation that eventually turns painful sensitization is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism active learning occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience since understanding information is the key aspect of learning , it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings 15–20 in addition , learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn conversely , passive learning and direct instruction are characteristics of teacher-centered learning ( or traditional education ) associative learning is the process by which a person or animal learns an association between two stimuli or events in classical conditioning a previously neutral stimulus is repeatedly paired with a reflex eliciting stimulus until eventually the neutral stimulus elicits a response on its own in operant conditioning , a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus in operant conditioning , a reinforcement ( by reward ) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior , changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior stimulus present when the behavior/consequence occurs come to control these behavior modifications following conditioning , the response occurs both to the unconditioned stimulus and to the other , unrelated stimulus ( now referred to as the '' conditioned stimulus '' ) the response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a conditioned response the classic example is ivan pavlov and his dogs meat powder is the unconditioned stimulus ( us ) and the salivation is the unconditioned response ( ur ) classical conditioning has been demonstrated in many species watson 's view was that the introspective method was too subjective and that we should limit the study of human development to directly observable behaviors imprinting is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior in 1935 , the austrian zoologist konrad lorenz discovered that certain birds follow and form a bond if the object makes sounds cats are known to play with a ball of string when young , which gives them experience with catching prey besides inanimate objects , animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals , such as orcas playing with seals they have caught play is generally seen in younger animals , suggesting a link with learning however , it may also have other benefits not associated directly with learning , for example improving physical fitness play , as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child 's learning and development through play , children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration as a form of learning , play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children play as a form of learning , can occur solitarily , or involve interacting with others parents , other adults , and peers shape the individual 's understanding of these values multiple examples of enculturation can be found cross-culturally chillihuani girls in peru described themselves as weaving constantly , following behavior shown by the other adults episodic learning is so named because events are recorded into episodic memory , which is one of the three forms of explicit learning and retrieval , along with perceptual memory and semantic memory london : elsevier ltd he would use semantic memory to answer someone who would ask him information such as where the grand canyon is this is said to indicate a very large storage capacity of the brain for things that people pay attention to this type of learning relies on dual-coding theory electronic learning or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning a specific and always more diffused e-learning is mobile learning ( m-learning ) , which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment , such as cellular phones by personalizing instruction , augmented learning has been shown to improve learning performance for a lifetime augmented learning , augmented learning : context-aware mobile augmented reality architecture for learning see also minimally invasive education communication between and among peers with or without the teacher present ) , learner–instructor ( i.e the major technique used for rote learning is learning by repetition , based on the idea that a learner can recall the material exactly ( but not its meaning ) if the information is repeatedly processed rote learning is used in diverse areas , from mathematics to music to religion although it has been criticized by some educators , rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning , a fact ) is fully understood to the extent that it relates to other knowledge to this end , meaningful learning contrasts with rote learning in which information is acquired without regard to understanding meaningful learning , on the other hand , implies there is a comprehensive knowledge of the context of the facts learned in formal learning , the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning nonformal learning is organized learning outside the formal learning system for example , learning by coming together with people with similar interests and exchanging viewpoints , in clubs or in ( international ) youth organizations , workshops it may occur through the experience of day-to-day situations ( for example , one would learn to look ahead while walking because of the danger inherent in not paying attention to where one is going ) the educational system may use a combination of formal , informal , and nonformal learning methods the un and eu recognize these different forms of learning ( cf tangential learning is the process by which people self-educate if a topic is exposed to them in a context that they already enjoy tangential learning self-education can be improved with systematization the built-in encyclopedias in the civilization games are presented as an example – by using these modules gamers can dig deeper for knowledge about historical events in the gameplay the importance of rules that regulate learning modules and game experience is discussed by moreno , c an instructor prompts the student to respond if needed affective : to like something or someone , love , appreciate , fear , hate , worship , etc ; tiredness , bodily weakness , and bad health are great obstructers in learning however , in environments where change occurs within an animal 's lifetime but is not constant , learning is more likely to evolve machine learning , a branch of artificial intelligence , concerns the construction and study of systems that can learn from data

non-associative learning refers to '' a relatively permanent change in the strength of response to a single stimulus due to repeated exposure to that stimulus habituation is an example of non-associative learning in which one or more components of an innate response ( e.g thus , habituation must be distinguished from extinction , which is an associative process in operant extinction , for example , a response declines because it is no longer followed by a reward an example of habituation can be seen in small song birds—if a stuffed owl ( or similar predator ) is put into the cage , the birds initially react to it as though it were a real predator soon the birds react less , showing habituation the habituation process is faster for stimuli that occur at a high rather than for stimuli that occur at a low rate as well as for the weak and strong stimuli , respectively this concept acts in direct opposition to sensitization sensitization is an example of non-associative learning in which the progressive amplification of a response follows repeated administrations of a stimulus ( bell et al an everyday example of this mechanism is the repeated tonic stimulation of peripheral nerves that occurs if a person rubs their arm continuously the pain results from the progressively amplified synaptic response of the peripheral nerves warning that the stimulation is harmful sensitization is thought to underlie both adaptive as well as maladaptive learning processes in the organism active learning occurs when a person takes control of his/her learning experience since understanding information is the key aspect of learning , it is important for learners to recognize what they understand and what they do not active learning encourages learners to have an internal dialogue in which they verbalize understandings this and other meta-cognitive strategies can be taught to a child over time studies within metacognition have proven the value in active learning , claiming that the learning is usually at a stronger level as a result 15–20 in addition , learners have more incentive to learn when they have control over not only how they learn but also what they learn active learning is a key characteristic of student-centered learning conversely , passive learning and direct instruction are characteristics of teacher-centered learning ( or traditional education ) associative learning is the process by which a person or animal learns an association between two stimuli or events in operant conditioning , a behavior that is reinforced or punished in the presence of a stimulus becomes more or less likely to occur in the presence of that stimulus in operant conditioning , a reinforcement ( by reward ) or instead a punishment is given after a given behavior , changing the frequency and/or form of that behavior the response to the conditioned stimulus is termed a conditioned response the first time pavlov rang the bell , the neutral stimulus , the dogs did not salivate , but once he put the meat powder in their mouths they began to salivate once this occurred , the bell became the conditioned stimulus ( cs ) and the salivation to the bell became the conditioned response ( cr ) for example , it is seen in honeybees , in the proboscis extension reflex paradigm watson 's most famous , and controversial , experiment was '' little albert '' , where he demonstrated how psychologists can account for the learning of emotion through classical conditioning principles in humans , this form of learning seems to not need reinforcement to occur , but instead , requires a social model such as a parent , sibling , friend , or teacher with surroundings imprinting is a kind of learning occurring at a particular life stage that is rapid and apparently independent of the consequences of behavior in filial imprinting , young animals , particularly birds , form an association with another individual or in some cases , an object , that they respond to as they would to a parent cats are known to play with a ball of string when young , which gives them experience with catching prey besides inanimate objects , animals may play with other members of their own species or other animals , such as orcas playing with seals they have caught play involves a significant cost to animals , such as increased vulnerability to predators and the risk of injury and possibly infection it also consumes energy , so there must be significant benefits associated with play for it to have evolved play is generally seen in younger animals , suggesting a link with learning play , as it pertains to humans as a form of learning is central to a child 's learning and development through play , children learn social skills such as sharing and collaboration as a form of learning , play also facilitates the development of thinking and language skills in children children and play in early childhood education : an exciting challenge play as a form of learning , can occur solitarily , or involve interacting with others enculturation is the process by which people learn values and behaviors that are appropriate or necessary in their surrounding culture '' handbook of socialization : theory and research '' , 2007 , guilford press ; ; at p as the children participated in everyday activities , they learned the cultural significance of these interactions the collaborative and helpful behaviors exhibited by mexican and mexican-heritage children is a cultural practice known as being '' acomedido '' he would use semantic memory to answer someone who would ask him information such as where the grand canyon is electronic learning or e-learning is computer-enhanced learning a specific and always more diffused e-learning is mobile learning ( m-learning ) , which uses different mobile telecommunication equipment , such as cellular phones by adapting to the needs of individuals , the context-driven instruction can be dynamically tailored to the learner 's natural environment rote learning is memorizing information so that it can be recalled by the learner exactly the way it was read or heard although it has been criticized by some educators , rote learning is a necessary precursor to meaningful learning meaningful learning is the concept that learned knowledge ( e.g to this end , meaningful learning contrasts with rote learning in which information is acquired without regard to understanding evidence-based learning is the use of evidence from well designed scientific studies to accelerate learning evidence-based learning methods such as spaced repetition can increase the rate at which a student learns in formal learning , the learning or training departments set out the goals and objectives of the learning , '' informal learning in the workplace '' , department for education and employment research report no it is learning from life , during a meal at the table with parents , play , exploring , etc nonformal learning and combined approaches the educational system may use a combination of formal , informal , and nonformal learning methods the un and eu recognize these different forms of learning ( cf the importance of rules that regulate learning modules and game experience is discussed by moreno , c in this game , developed by landka in collaboration with esa and eso , progress is rewarded with educational content , as opposed to traditional education games where learning activities are rewarded with gameplay dialogic learning is a type of learning based on dialogue research implies that some un-assessed aspects of onsite and online learning challenge the equivalency of education between the two modalities both onsite and online learning have distinct advantages with traditional on-campus students experiencing higher degrees of incidental learning in three times as many areas as online students guidance covers the whole gamut of learners problems- learning as well as non-learning the concepts of learning and memory are relevant in identifying how plants respond to external cues , a behavior necessary for survival

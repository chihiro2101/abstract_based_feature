the upnp architecture allows device-to-device networking of consumer electronics , mobile devices , personal computers , and networked home appliances it is a distributed , open architecture protocol based on established standards such as the internet protocol suite ( tcp/ip ) , http , xml , and soap upnp control points ( cps ) are devices which use upnp protocols to control upnp controlled devices ( cds ) the upnp architecture supports zero configuration networking a upnp compatible device from any vendor can dynamically join a network , obtain an ip address , announce its name , advertise or convey its capabilities upon request , and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices devices can disconnect from the network automatically without leaving state information ; user interface ( ui ) control : optionally , the upnp architecture enables devices to present a user interface through a web browser ( see presentation below ) ; operating system and programming language independence : any operating system and any programming language can be used to build upnp products in addition to combining services defined by upnp forum in various ways , vendors can define their own device and service types , and can extend standard devices and services with vendor-defined actions , state variables , data structure elements , and variable values it assumes the network must run internet protocol ( ip ) and then leverages http , soap and xml on top of ip , in order to provide device/service description , actions , data transfer and eventing device search requests and advertisements are supported by running http on top of udp using multicast ( known as httpmu ) responses to search requests are also sent over udp , but are instead sent using unicast ( known as httpu ) httpu and httpmu were initially submitted as an internet draft but it expired in 2001 ; these specifications have since been integrated into the actual upnp specifications each device must implement a dhcp client and search for a dhcp server when the device is first connected to the network the upnp discovery protocol is known as the simple service discovery protocol ( ssdp ) when a device is added to the network , ssdp allows that device to advertise its services to control points on the network when a control point is added to the network , ssdp allows that control point to actively search for devices of interest on the network or listen passively to the ssdp alive messages of device the event notification protocol defined in the upnp device architecture is known as general event notification architecture ( gena ) event messages contain the names of one or more state variables and the current value of those variables since 2006 , versions 3 and 4 of the upnp audio and video device control protocols have been published in march 2013 , an updated upnp av architecture specification was published , incorporating the updated device control protocols a is the upnp-server ( '' master '' device ) that provides media library information and streams media-data ( like audio/video/picture/files ) to upnp clients on the network that means that one can control a home networking device through any web browser-based communications method for ce devices on a upnp home network using ethernet and a special version of html called ce-html remote access - defines methods for connecting upnp device sets that are not in the same multicast domain when the authentication mechanisms are not implemented , routers and firewalls running the upnp igd protocol are vulnerable to attack the devices profile for web services ( dpws ) standard was a candidate successor to upnp , but upnp 1.1 was selected by the upnp forum

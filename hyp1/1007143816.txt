the upnp architecture allows device-to-device networking of consumer electronics , mobile devices , personal computers , and networked home appliances upnp control points ( cps ) are devices which use upnp protocols to control upnp controlled devices ( cds ) a upnp compatible device from any vendor can dynamically join a network , obtain an ip address , announce its name , advertise or convey its capabilities upon request , and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices dynamic host configuration protocol ( dhcp ) and domain name system ( dns ) servers are optional and are only used if they are available on the network other upnp features include : ; media and device independence : upnp technology can run on many media that support ip including ethernet , firewire , ir ( irda ) , home wiring ( g.hn ) and rf ( bluetooth , wi-fi ) ; user interface ( ui ) control : optionally , the upnp architecture enables devices to present a user interface through a web browser ( see presentation below ) device search requests and advertisements are supported by running http on top of udp using multicast ( known as httpmu ) responses to search requests are also sent over udp , but are instead sent using unicast ( known as httpu ) upnp uses udp port 1900 and all used tcp ports are derived from the ssdp alive and response messages each device must implement a dhcp client and search for a dhcp server when the device is first connected to the network in upnp device architecture version 1.0 , autoip is defined within the specification itself ; in upnp device architecture version 1.1 , autoip references ietf rfc 3927 if during the dhcp transaction , the device obtains a domain name , for example , through a dns server or via dns forwarding , the device should use that name in subsequent network operations ; otherwise , the device should use its ip address when a device is added to the network , ssdp allows that device to advertise its services to control points on the network when a control point is added to the network , ssdp allows that control point to actively search for devices of interest on the network or listen passively to the ssdp alive messages of device after a control point has discovered a device , the control point still knows very little about the device for each service , the device description document lists the urls for control , eventing and service description having retrieved a description of the device , the control point can send actions to a device 's service to do this , a control point sends a suitable control message to the control url for the service ( provided in the device description ) the event notification protocol defined in the upnp device architecture is known as general event notification architecture ( gena ) the upnp av standards have been referenced in specifications published by other organizations including digital living network alliance networked device interoperability guidelines , international electrotechnical commission iec 62481-1 , and cablelabs opencable home networking protocol hardware-based upnp av media servers may run on any nas devices or any specific hardware for delivering media , such as a dvr web-based protocol and framework for remote user interface on upnp networks and the internet ( web4ce ) the upnp protocol , as default , does not implement any authentication , so upnp device implementations must implement the additional device protection service , or implement the device security service as a result , some upnp devices ship with upnp turned off by default as a security measure in 2011 , researcher daniel garcia developed a tool designed to exploit a flaw in some upnp igd device stacks that allow upnp requests from the internet in the fall of 2008 , the upnp forum ratified the successor to upnp 1.0 device architecture upnp 1.1

the upnp architecture allows device-to-device networking of consumer electronics , mobile devices , personal computers , and networked home appliances upnp control points ( cps ) are devices which use upnp protocols to control upnp controlled devices ( cds ) the upnp architecture supports zero configuration networking a upnp compatible device from any vendor can dynamically join a network , obtain an ip address , announce its name , advertise or convey its capabilities upon request , and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices other upnp features include : ; media and device independence : upnp technology can run on many media that support ip including ethernet , firewire , ir ( irda ) , home wiring ( g.hn ) and rf ( bluetooth , wi-fi ) ; user interface ( ui ) control : optionally , the upnp architecture enables devices to present a user interface through a web browser ( see presentation below ) ; operating system and programming language independence : any operating system and any programming language can be used to build upnp products in addition to combining services defined by upnp forum in various ways , vendors can define their own device and service types , and can extend standard devices and services with vendor-defined actions , state variables , data structure elements , and variable values it assumes the network must run internet protocol ( ip ) and then leverages http , soap and xml on top of ip , in order to provide device/service description , actions , data transfer and eventing responses to search requests are also sent over udp , but are instead sent using unicast ( known as httpu ) upnp uses udp port 1900 and all used tcp ports are derived from the ssdp alive and response messages each device must implement a dhcp client and search for a dhcp server when the device is first connected to the network the process by which a upnp device assigns itself an address is known within the upnp device architecture as autoip if during the dhcp transaction , the device obtains a domain name , for example , through a dns server or via dns forwarding , the device should use that name in subsequent network operations ; otherwise , the device should use its ip address once a device has established an ip address , the next step in upnp networking is discovery when a device is added to the network , ssdp allows that device to advertise its services to control points on the network when a control point is added to the network , ssdp allows that control point to actively search for devices of interest on the network or listen passively to the ssdp alive messages of device after a control point has discovered a device , the control point still knows very little about the device for the control point to learn more about the device and its capabilities , or to interact with the device , the control point must retrieve the device 's description from the location ( url ) provided by the device in the discovery message the upnp device description is expressed in xml and includes vendor-specific manufacturer information like the model name and number , serial number , manufacturer name , ( presentation ) urls to vendor-specific web sites , etc having retrieved a description of the device , the control point can send actions to a device 's service to do this , a control point sends a suitable control message to the control url for the service ( provided in the device description ) that means that one can control a home networking device through any web browser-based communications method for ce devices on a upnp home network using ethernet and a special version of html called ce-html there also exists a non-standard solution called upnp-up ( universal plug and play - user profile ) which proposes an extension to allow user authentication and authorization mechanisms for upnp devices and applications upnp is often the only significant multicast application in use in digital home networks ; therefore , multicast network misconfiguration or other deficiencies can appear as upnp issues rather than underlying network issues the devices profile for web services ( dpws ) standard was a candidate successor to upnp , but upnp 1.1 was selected by the upnp forum

the upnp architecture allows device-to-device networking of consumer electronics , mobile devices , personal computers , and networked home appliances upnp control points ( cps ) are devices which use upnp protocols to control upnp controlled devices ( cds ) a upnp compatible device from any vendor can dynamically join a network , obtain an ip address , announce its name , advertise or convey its capabilities upon request , and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices dynamic host configuration protocol ( dhcp ) and domain name system ( dns ) servers are optional and are only used if they are available on the network other upnp features include : ; media and device independence : upnp technology can run on many media that support ip including ethernet , firewire , ir ( irda ) , home wiring ( g.hn ) and rf ( bluetooth , wi-fi ) no special device driver support is necessary ; common network protocols are used instead ; user interface ( ui ) control : optionally , the upnp architecture enables devices to present a user interface through a web browser ( see presentation below ) ; operating system and programming language independence : any operating system and any programming language can be used to build upnp products ; extensibility : each upnp product can have device-specific services layered on top of the basic architecture it assumes the network must run internet protocol ( ip ) and then leverages http , soap and xml on top of ip , in order to provide device/service description , actions , data transfer and eventing each device must implement a dhcp client and search for a dhcp server when the device is first connected to the network the process by which a upnp device assigns itself an address is known within the upnp device architecture as autoip in upnp device architecture version 1.0 , autoip is defined within the specification itself ; in upnp device architecture version 1.1 , autoip references ietf rfc 3927 the upnp discovery protocol is known as the simple service discovery protocol ( ssdp ) when a device is added to the network , ssdp allows that device to advertise its services to control points on the network when a control point is added to the network , ssdp allows that control point to actively search for devices of interest on the network or listen passively to the ssdp alive messages of device for the control point to learn more about the device and its capabilities , or to interact with the device , the control point must retrieve the device 's description from the location ( url ) provided by the device in the discovery message the upnp device description is expressed in xml and includes vendor-specific manufacturer information like the model name and number , serial number , manufacturer name , ( presentation ) urls to vendor-specific web sites , etc to do this , a control point sends a suitable control message to the control url for the service ( provided in the device description ) much like function calls , the service returns any action-specific values in response to the control message the event notification protocol defined in the upnp device architecture is known as general event notification architecture ( gena ) a special initial event message is sent when a control point first subscribes ; this event message contains the names and values for all evented variables and allows the subscriber to initialize its model of the state of the service hardware-based upnp av media servers may run on any nas devices or any specific hardware for delivering media , such as a dvr the upnp protocol , as default , does not implement any authentication , so upnp device implementations must implement the additional device protection service , or implement the device security service in the fall of 2008 , the upnp forum ratified the successor to upnp 1.0 device architecture upnp 1.1 the devices profile for web services ( dpws ) standard was a candidate successor to upnp , but upnp 1.1 was selected by the upnp forum

the upnp architecture allows device-to-device networking of consumer electronics , mobile devices , personal computers , and networked home appliances upnp control points ( cps ) are devices which use upnp protocols to control upnp controlled devices ( cds ) the upnp architecture supports zero configuration networking a upnp compatible device from any vendor can dynamically join a network , obtain an ip address , announce its name , advertise or convey its capabilities upon request , and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices dynamic host configuration protocol ( dhcp ) and domain name system ( dns ) servers are optional and are only used if they are available on the network devices can disconnect from the network automatically without leaving state information other upnp features include : ; media and device independence : upnp technology can run on many media that support ip including ethernet , firewire , ir ( irda ) , home wiring ( g.hn ) and rf ( bluetooth , wi-fi ) ; user interface ( ui ) control : optionally , the upnp architecture enables devices to present a user interface through a web browser ( see presentation below ) it assumes the network must run internet protocol ( ip ) and then leverages http , soap and xml on top of ip , in order to provide device/service description , actions , data transfer and eventing responses to search requests are also sent over udp , but are instead sent using unicast ( known as httpu ) the foundation for upnp networking is ip addressing each device must implement a dhcp client and search for a dhcp server when the device is first connected to the network in upnp device architecture version 1.0 , autoip is defined within the specification itself ; in upnp device architecture version 1.1 , autoip references ietf rfc 3927 once a device has established an ip address , the next step in upnp networking is discovery when a device is added to the network , ssdp allows that device to advertise its services to control points on the network when a control point is added to the network , ssdp allows that control point to actively search for devices of interest on the network or listen passively to the ssdp alive messages of device after a control point has discovered a device , the control point still knows very little about the device for each service , the device description document lists the urls for control , eventing and service description to do this , a control point sends a suitable control message to the control url for the service ( provided in the device description ) the event notification protocol defined in the upnp device architecture is known as general event notification architecture ( gena ) a upnp description for a service includes a list of actions the service responds to and a list of variables that model the state of the service at run time since 2006 , versions 3 and 4 of the upnp audio and video device control protocols have been published upnp av media servers provide a service to upnp av client devices , so-called control points , for browsing the media content of the server and request the media server to deliver a file to the control point for playback many upnp device implementations lack authentication mechanisms , and by default assume local systems and their users are completely trustworthy the devices profile for web services ( dpws ) standard was a candidate successor to upnp , but upnp 1.1 was selected by the upnp forum the upnp internet gateway device ( igd ) standard has a wanipconnection service , which provides similar functionality to ietf-standard port control protocol

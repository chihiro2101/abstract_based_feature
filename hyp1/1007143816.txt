the upnp architecture allows device-to-device networking of consumer electronics , mobile devices , personal computers , and networked home appliances it is a distributed , open architecture protocol based on established standards such as the internet protocol suite ( tcp/ip ) , http , xml , and soap upnp control points ( cps ) are devices which use upnp protocols to control upnp controlled devices ( cds ) the upnp architecture supports zero configuration networking devices can disconnect from the network automatically without leaving state information ; user interface ( ui ) control : optionally , the upnp architecture enables devices to present a user interface through a web browser ( see presentation below ) it assumes the network must run internet protocol ( ip ) and then leverages http , soap and xml on top of ip , in order to provide device/service description , actions , data transfer and eventing device search requests and advertisements are supported by running http on top of udp using multicast ( known as httpmu ) responses to search requests are also sent over udp , but are instead sent using unicast ( known as httpu ) httpu and httpmu were initially submitted as an internet draft but it expired in 2001 ; these specifications have since been integrated into the actual upnp specifications upnp uses udp port 1900 and all used tcp ports are derived from the ssdp alive and response messages the foundation for upnp networking is ip addressing the process by which a upnp device assigns itself an address is known within the upnp device architecture as autoip in upnp device architecture version 1.0 , autoip is defined within the specification itself ; in upnp device architecture version 1.1 , autoip references ietf rfc 3927 once a device has established an ip address , the next step in upnp networking is discovery when a device is added to the network , ssdp allows that device to advertise its services to control points on the network the fundamental exchange is a discovery message containing a few essential specifics about the device or one of its services , for example , its type , identifier , and a pointer ( network location ) to more detailed information after a control point has discovered a device , the control point still knows very little about the device for the control point to learn more about the device and its capabilities , or to interact with the device , the control point must retrieve the device 's description from the location ( url ) provided by the device in the discovery message for each service , the device description document lists the urls for control , eventing and service description having retrieved a description of the device , the control point can send actions to a device 's service to do this , a control point sends a suitable control message to the control url for the service ( provided in the device description ) hardware-based upnp av media servers may run on any nas devices or any specific hardware for delivering media , such as a dvr this standard allows a upnp-capable home network device to provide its interface ( display and control options ) as a web page to display on any other device connected to the home network the devices profile for web services ( dpws ) standard was a candidate successor to upnp , but upnp 1.1 was selected by the upnp forum the upnp internet gateway device ( igd ) standard has a wanipconnection service , which provides similar functionality to ietf-standard port control protocol

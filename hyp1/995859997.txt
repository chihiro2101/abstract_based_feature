succinylcholine chloride injection indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation it is indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy , favoured for its short duration of action suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes when plasma levels of butyrylcholinesterase are greatly diminished or an atypical form is present ( an otherwise harmless inherited disorder ) , paralysis may last much longer , as is the case in liver failure or in neonates side effects include malignant hyperthermia , muscle pains , acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia , transient ocular hypertension , constipation and changes in cardiac rhythm , including bradycardia , and cardiac arrest in people with neuromuscular disease or burns , an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles , potentially resulting in cardiac arrest suxamethonium does not produce unconsciousness or anesthesia , and its effects may cause considerable psychological distress while simultaneously making it impossible for a patient to communicate the side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine receptor is propped open , allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the extracellular fluid a typical increase of potassium ion serum concentration on administration of suxamethonium is 0.5 & nbsp ; mmol per liter high blood potassium does not generally result in adverse effects below a concentration of 6.5 to 7 meq per liter malignant hyperthermia ( mh ) from suxamethonium administration can result in a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism the normal short duration of action of suxamethonium is due to the rapid metabolism of the drug by non-specific plasma cholinesterases suxamethonium has a longer duration of effect than acetylcholine , and is not hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase

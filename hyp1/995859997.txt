it is indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy , favoured for its short duration of action suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes side effects include malignant hyperthermia , muscle pains , acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia , transient ocular hypertension , constipation and changes in cardiac rhythm , including bradycardia , and cardiac arrest in people with neuromuscular disease or burns , an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles , potentially resulting in cardiac arrest suxamethonium does not produce unconsciousness or anesthesia , and its effects may cause considerable psychological distress while simultaneously making it impossible for a patient to communicate the side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine receptor is propped open , allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the extracellular fluid a typical increase of potassium ion serum concentration on administration of suxamethonium is 0.5 & nbsp ; mmol per liter malignant hyperthermia ( mh ) from suxamethonium administration can result in a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism susceptibility to malignant hyperthermia is often inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder , for which there are at least six gene of interest , the most prominent being the ryanodine receptor gene ( ryr1 ) the normal short duration of action of suxamethonium is due to the rapid metabolism of the drug by non-specific plasma cholinesterases however plasma cholinesterase activity is reduced in some people due to either genetic variation or acquired conditions , which results in a prolonged duration of neuromuscular block in normal skeletal muscle , acetylcholine dissociates from the receptor following depolarization and is rapidly hydrolyzed by the enzyme acetylcholinesterase suxamethonium has a longer duration of effect than acetylcholine , and is not hydrolyzed by acetylcholinesterase

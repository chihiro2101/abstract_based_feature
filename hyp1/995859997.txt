succinylcholine chloride injection indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation it may be better than rocuronium in people without contraindications due to its faster onset of action and shorter duration of action it is indicated , in addition to general anesthesia , to facilitate tracheal intubation and to provide skeletal muscle relaxation during surgery or mechanical ventilation suxamethonium is also commonly used as the sole muscle relaxant during electroconvulsive therapy , favoured for its short duration of action suxamethonium is quickly degraded by plasma butyrylcholinesterase and the duration of effect is usually in the range of a few minutes side effects include malignant hyperthermia , muscle pains , acute rhabdomyolysis with hyperkalemia , transient ocular hypertension , constipation and changes in cardiac rhythm , including bradycardia , and cardiac arrest in people with neuromuscular disease or burns , an injection of suxamethonium can lead to a large release of potassium from skeletal muscles , potentially resulting in cardiac arrest suxamethonium does not produce unconsciousness or anesthesia , and its effects may cause considerable psychological distress while simultaneously making it impossible for a patient to communicate the side effect of high blood potassium may occur because the acetylcholine receptor is propped open , allowing continued flow of potassium ions into the extracellular fluid high blood potassium does not generally result in adverse effects below a concentration of 6.5 to 7 meq per liter malignant hyperthermia ( mh ) from suxamethonium administration can result in a drastic and uncontrolled increase in skeletal muscle oxidative metabolism this use was discontinued after negative publicity concerning the terrifying effects on subjects of this treatment and ethical questions about the punitive use of painful aversion it is caused by the blood concentration of suxamethonium exceeding the therapeutic window when studying the drug , animals were given curare and thus they missed the neuromuscular blocking properties of suxamethonium

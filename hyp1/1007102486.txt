prior to holtzmann , most catholic scholars held to the augustinian hypothesis ( matthew → mark → luke ) and protestant biblical critics favored the griesbach hypothesis ( matthew → luke → mark ) the hypothesis is a solution to what is known as the synoptic problem : the question of how best to account for the differences and similarities between the three synoptic gospels , matthew , mark and luke any solution to the synoptic problem needs to account for two features : the '' triple tradition '' : the three gospels frequently share both wording and arrangement of '' pericopes '' ( incidents , stories - this substantial sharing is what led to them being called '' synoptic '' , or seeing-together ) where they differ on this shared material , mark and luke will agree against matthew , or mark and matthew will agree against luke , but very rarely will mark be the odd one out the '' double tradition '' : sometimes matthew and luke share material which is not present in mark the 2sh explains the features of the triple tradition by proposing that both matthew and luke used mark as a source the more sophisticated versions of mark 's pericopes in matthew and luke must be either the result of those two '' cleaning up '' mark , if his is the first gospel , or of mark '' dumbing down '' matthew and/or luke , if he was later it is this , rather than markan priority , which forms the distinctive feature of the 2sh as against rival theories the existence of q follows from the conclusion that , as luke and matthew are independent of mark in the double tradition , the connection between them must be explained by their joint but independent use of a missing source or sources a few later scholars explain the minor agreements as being due to luke 's using matthew in addition to q and mark ( 3sh ) but the modern argument for q requires matthew and luke to be independent , so the 3sh raises the question of how to establish a role for q if luke is dependent on matthew when similar changes occur in double tradition material , which according to the 2sh are the result of matthew and luke relying on q , they usually show luke converging on matthew this is sometimes called the modified two-document hypothesis ( although that term was also used in older literature to refer to the four-document hypothesis ) in britain , the most influential modern opponents of the 2sh favor the farrer hypothesis , while farmer 's revised griesbach hypothesis , also known as the two gospel hypothesis , is probably the chief rival to the two source hypothesis in america the traditional view is represented by the augustinian hypothesis , which is that the four gospels were written in the order in which they appear in the bible ( matthew → mark → luke ) , with mark a condensed edition of matthew by the 18th century the problems with augustine 's idea led johann jakob griesbach to put forward the griesbach hypothesis , which was that luke had revised matthew and that mark had then written a shorter gospel using material on which both matthew and luke agreed ( matthew → luke → mark )

the two-source hypothesis was first articulated in 1838 by christian hermann weisse , but it did not gain wide acceptance among german critics until heinrich julius holtzmann endorsed it in 1863 prior to holtzmann , most catholic scholars held to the augustinian hypothesis ( matthew → mark → luke ) and protestant biblical critics favored the griesbach hypothesis ( matthew → luke → mark ) streeter further argued that additional sources , referred to as m and l , lie behind the material in matthew and luke respectively the hypothesis is a solution to what is known as the synoptic problem : the question of how best to account for the differences and similarities between the three synoptic gospels , matthew , mark and luke any solution to the synoptic problem needs to account for two features : the '' triple tradition '' : the three gospels frequently share both wording and arrangement of '' pericopes '' ( incidents , stories - this substantial sharing is what led to them being called '' synoptic '' , or seeing-together ) where they differ on this shared material , mark and luke will agree against matthew , or mark and matthew will agree against luke , but very rarely will mark be the odd one out the 2sh attempts to solve the synoptic problem by advancing two propositions , markan priority to explain the triple tradition , and the existence of a lost q document to solve the double tradition the 2sh explains the features of the triple tradition by proposing that both matthew and luke used mark as a source on a more specific level , marcan priority seems to be indicated due to instances where matthew and luke apparently omit explanatory material from mark , where matthew adds his own theological emphases to mark 's stories , and in the uneven distribution of mark 's stylistic features in matthew '' the two-source hypothesis '' , synoptic problem website the '' minor agreements '' thus call into question the proposition that matthew and luke knew mark but not each other streeter devoted a chapter to the matter , arguing that the matthew/luke agreements were due to coincidence , or to the result of the two authors ' reworking of mark into more refined greek , or to overlaps with q or oral tradition , or to textual corruption but the modern argument for q requires matthew and luke to be independent , so the 3sh raises the question of how to establish a role for q if luke is dependent on matthew the two-document hypothesis emerged in the 19th century : mark as the earliest gospel , matthew and luke written independently and reliant on both mark and the hypothetical q in britain , the most influential modern opponents of the 2sh favor the farrer hypothesis , while farmer 's revised griesbach hypothesis , also known as the two gospel hypothesis , is probably the chief rival to the two source hypothesis in america biblical criticism historicity of jesus synoptic problem q source wilke hypothesis three-source hypothesis q+/papias hypothesis common sayings source gospel harmony

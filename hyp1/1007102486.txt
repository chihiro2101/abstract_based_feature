the two-source hypothesis was first articulated in 1838 by christian hermann weisse , but it did not gain wide acceptance among german critics until heinrich julius holtzmann endorsed it in 1863 prior to holtzmann , most catholic scholars held to the augustinian hypothesis ( matthew → mark → luke ) and protestant biblical critics favored the griesbach hypothesis ( matthew → luke → mark ) the two-source hypothesis crossed the channel into england in the 1880s primarily due to the efforts of william sanday , culminating in b streeter further argued that additional sources , referred to as m and l , lie behind the material in matthew and luke respectively the hypothesis is a solution to what is known as the synoptic problem : the question of how best to account for the differences and similarities between the three synoptic gospels , matthew , mark and luke any solution to the synoptic problem needs to account for two features : the '' triple tradition '' : the three gospels frequently share both wording and arrangement of '' pericopes '' ( incidents , stories - this substantial sharing is what led to them being called '' synoptic '' , or seeing-together ) where they differ on this shared material , mark and luke will agree against matthew , or mark and matthew will agree against luke , but very rarely will mark be the odd one out the '' double tradition '' : sometimes matthew and luke share material which is not present in mark in summary , the two-source hypothesis proposes that matthew and luke used mark for its narrative material as well as for the basic structural outline of chronology of jesus ' life ; and that matthew and luke use a second source , q ( from german quelle , '' source '' ) , not extant , for the sayings ( logia ) found in both of them but not in mark the more sophisticated versions of mark 's pericopes in matthew and luke must be either the result of those two '' cleaning up '' mark , if his is the first gospel , or of mark '' dumbing down '' matthew and/or luke , if he was later streeter devoted a chapter to the matter , arguing that the matthew/luke agreements were due to coincidence , or to the result of the two authors ' reworking of mark into more refined greek , or to overlaps with q or oral tradition , or to textual corruption a few later scholars explain the minor agreements as being due to luke 's using matthew in addition to q and mark ( 3sh ) the two-document hypothesis emerged in the 19th century : mark as the earliest gospel , matthew and luke written independently and reliant on both mark and the hypothetical q streeter refined the two-document hypothesis into the four-document hypothesis based on the possibility of a jewish m source ( see the gospel according to the hebrews ) a variant of the augustinian hypothesis , attempting to synchronise matthew and mark on the basis of the mosaic '' two witnesses '' requirement of deuteronomy 19:15 ( matthew + mark → luke ) , was proposed by eta linnemann , following rejection of the view of her teacher rudolf bultmann biblical criticism historicity of jesus synoptic problem q source wilke hypothesis three-source hypothesis q+/papias hypothesis common sayings source gospel harmony

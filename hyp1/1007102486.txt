prior to holtzmann , most catholic scholars held to the augustinian hypothesis ( matthew → mark → luke ) and protestant biblical critics favored the griesbach hypothesis ( matthew → luke → mark ) burnett hillman streeter , the four gospels , a study of origins treating of the manuscript tradition , sources , authorship , & dates , ( 1924 ) the hypothesis is a solution to what is known as the synoptic problem : the question of how best to account for the differences and similarities between the three synoptic gospels , matthew , mark and luke any solution to the synoptic problem needs to account for two features : the '' triple tradition '' : the three gospels frequently share both wording and arrangement of '' pericopes '' ( incidents , stories - this substantial sharing is what led to them being called '' synoptic '' , or seeing-together ) where they differ on this shared material , mark and luke will agree against matthew , or mark and matthew will agree against luke , but very rarely will mark be the odd one out '' the two-source hypothesis '' , mindspring.com in summary , the two-source hypothesis proposes that matthew and luke used mark for its narrative material as well as for the basic structural outline of chronology of jesus ' life ; and that matthew and luke use a second source , q ( from german quelle , '' source '' ) , not extant , for the sayings ( logia ) found in both of them but not in mark the 2sh explains the features of the triple tradition by proposing that both matthew and luke used mark as a source the more sophisticated versions of mark 's pericopes in matthew and luke must be either the result of those two '' cleaning up '' mark , if his is the first gospel , or of mark '' dumbing down '' matthew and/or luke , if he was later on a more specific level , marcan priority seems to be indicated due to instances where matthew and luke apparently omit explanatory material from mark , where matthew adds his own theological emphases to mark 's stories , and in the uneven distribution of mark 's stylistic features in matthew the existence of q follows from the conclusion that , as luke and matthew are independent of mark in the double tradition , the connection between them must be explained by their joint but independent use of a missing source or sources the '' minor agreements '' thus call into question the proposition that matthew and luke knew mark but not each other a few later scholars explain the minor agreements as being due to luke 's using matthew in addition to q and mark ( 3sh ) but the modern argument for q requires matthew and luke to be independent , so the 3sh raises the question of how to establish a role for q if luke is dependent on matthew the two-document hypothesis emerged in the 19th century : mark as the earliest gospel , matthew and luke written independently and reliant on both mark and the hypothetical q by the 18th century the problems with augustine 's idea led johann jakob griesbach to put forward the griesbach hypothesis , which was that luke had revised matthew and that mark had then written a shorter gospel using material on which both matthew and luke agreed ( matthew → luke → mark )

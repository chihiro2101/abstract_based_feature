the two-source hypothesis was first articulated in 1838 by christian hermann weisse , but it did not gain wide acceptance among german critics until heinrich julius holtzmann endorsed it in 1863 prior to holtzmann , most catholic scholars held to the augustinian hypothesis ( matthew → mark → luke ) and protestant biblical critics favored the griesbach hypothesis ( matthew → luke → mark ) streeter further argued that additional sources , referred to as m and l , lie behind the material in matthew and luke respectively the hypothesis is a solution to what is known as the synoptic problem : the question of how best to account for the differences and similarities between the three synoptic gospels , matthew , mark and luke any solution to the synoptic problem needs to account for two features : the '' triple tradition '' : the three gospels frequently share both wording and arrangement of '' pericopes '' ( incidents , stories - this substantial sharing is what led to them being called '' synoptic '' , or seeing-together ) in summary , the two-source hypothesis proposes that matthew and luke used mark for its narrative material as well as for the basic structural outline of chronology of jesus ' life ; and that matthew and luke use a second source , q ( from german quelle , '' source '' ) , not extant , for the sayings ( logia ) found in both of them but not in mark the 2sh explains the features of the triple tradition by proposing that both matthew and luke used mark as a source the more sophisticated versions of mark 's pericopes in matthew and luke must be either the result of those two '' cleaning up '' mark , if his is the first gospel , or of mark '' dumbing down '' matthew and/or luke , if he was later the '' minor agreements '' —the word '' minor '' here is not intended to be belittling—are those points where matthew and luke agree against mark ( for example , the mocking question at the beating of jesus , '' who is it that struck you ? '' , found in both matthew and luke but not in mark ) the '' minor agreements '' thus call into question the proposition that matthew and luke knew mark but not each other a few later scholars explain the minor agreements as being due to luke 's using matthew in addition to q and mark ( 3sh ) but the modern argument for q requires matthew and luke to be independent , so the 3sh raises the question of how to establish a role for q if luke is dependent on matthew the two-document hypothesis emerged in the 19th century : mark as the earliest gospel , matthew and luke written independently and reliant on both mark and the hypothetical q farrer , proposed that one could dispense with q by arguing that luke revised both mark and matthew in britain , the most influential modern opponents of the 2sh favor the farrer hypothesis , while farmer 's revised griesbach hypothesis , also known as the two gospel hypothesis , is probably the chief rival to the two source hypothesis in america biblical criticism historicity of jesus synoptic problem q source wilke hypothesis three-source hypothesis q+/papias hypothesis common sayings source gospel harmony

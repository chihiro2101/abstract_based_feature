the two-source hypothesis was first articulated in 1838 by christian hermann weisse , but it did not gain wide acceptance among german critics until heinrich julius holtzmann endorsed it in 1863 prior to holtzmann , most catholic scholars held to the augustinian hypothesis ( matthew → mark → luke ) and protestant biblical critics favored the griesbach hypothesis ( matthew → luke → mark ) streeter further argued that additional sources , referred to as m and l , lie behind the material in matthew and luke respectively the hypothesis is a solution to what is known as the synoptic problem : the question of how best to account for the differences and similarities between the three synoptic gospels , matthew , mark and luke any solution to the synoptic problem needs to account for two features : the '' triple tradition '' : the three gospels frequently share both wording and arrangement of '' pericopes '' ( incidents , stories - this substantial sharing is what led to them being called '' synoptic '' , or seeing-together ) where they differ on this shared material , mark and luke will agree against matthew , or mark and matthew will agree against luke , but very rarely will mark be the odd one out matthew 's and luke 's versions of shared pericopes will usually be shorter than mark 's in summary , the two-source hypothesis proposes that matthew and luke used mark for its narrative material as well as for the basic structural outline of chronology of jesus ' life ; and that matthew and luke use a second source , q ( from german quelle , '' source '' ) , not extant , for the sayings ( logia ) found in both of them but not in mark the 2sh explains the features of the triple tradition by proposing that both matthew and luke used mark as a source the more sophisticated versions of mark 's pericopes in matthew and luke must be either the result of those two '' cleaning up '' mark , if his is the first gospel , or of mark '' dumbing down '' matthew and/or luke , if he was later on a more specific level , marcan priority seems to be indicated due to instances where matthew and luke apparently omit explanatory material from mark , where matthew adds his own theological emphases to mark 's stories , and in the uneven distribution of mark 's stylistic features in matthew the '' minor agreements '' —the word '' minor '' here is not intended to be belittling—are those points where matthew and luke agree against mark ( for example , the mocking question at the beating of jesus , '' who is it that struck you ? '' , found in both matthew and luke but not in mark ) a few later scholars explain the minor agreements as being due to luke 's using matthew in addition to q and mark ( 3sh ) the two-document hypothesis emerged in the 19th century : mark as the earliest gospel , matthew and luke written independently and reliant on both mark and the hypothetical q in britain , the most influential modern opponents of the 2sh favor the farrer hypothesis , while farmer 's revised griesbach hypothesis , also known as the two gospel hypothesis , is probably the chief rival to the two source hypothesis in america by the 18th century the problems with augustine 's idea led johann jakob griesbach to put forward the griesbach hypothesis , which was that luke had revised matthew and that mark had then written a shorter gospel using material on which both matthew and luke agreed ( matthew → luke → mark )

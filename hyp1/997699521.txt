the subaru telescope is a ritchey-chretien reflecting telescope instruments can be mounted at a cassegrain focus below the primary mirror ; at either of two nasmyth focal points in enclosures on the sides of the telescope mount , to which light can be directed with a tertiary mirror ; or at the prime focus in lieu of a secondary mirror , an arrangement rare on large telescopes , to provide a wide field of view suited to deep wide-field surveys in 1985 , the astronomy committee of japan 's science council gave top priority to the development of a '' japan national large telescope '' ( jnlt ) , and in 1986 , the university of tokyo signed an agreement with the university of hawaii to build the telescope in hawaii in 1988 , the national astronomical observatory of japan was formed through a reorganization of the university 's tokyo astronomical observatory , to oversee the jnlt and other large national astronomy projects construction of the subaru telescope began in april 1991 , and later that year , a public contest gave the telescope its official name , '' subaru telescope the telescope enclosure building is also shaped to improve the quality of astronomical images by minimizing the effects caused by atmospheric turbulence ; multi-object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ) : wide-field camera and spectrograph with the ability to take spectra of multiple objects simultaneously , mounts at the cassegrain focus for example , at a distance of 100 pc , the piaa coronagraph on scexao would be able to image from 4 au outwards while gemini planet imager and vlt-sphere from 12 au outwards scexao will initially use the hiciao camera but this will be replaced by charis , an integral field spectrograph , around 2016 .

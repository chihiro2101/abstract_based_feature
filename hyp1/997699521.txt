the subaru telescope is a ritchey-chretien reflecting telescope in 1984 , the university of tokyo formed an engineering working group to develop and study the concept of a telescope in 1985 , the astronomy committee of japan 's science council gave top priority to the development of a '' japan national large telescope '' ( jnlt ) , and in 1986 , the university of tokyo signed an agreement with the university of hawaii to build the telescope in hawaii in 1988 , the national astronomical observatory of japan was formed through a reorganization of the university 's tokyo astronomical observatory , to oversee the jnlt and other large national astronomy projects for example , 261 computer-controlled actuators press the main mirror from underneath , which corrects for primary mirror distortion caused by changes in the telescope orientation several cameras and spectrographs can be mounted at subaru telescope 's four focal points for observations in visible and infrared wavelengths ; multi-object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ) : wide-field camera and spectrograph with the ability to take spectra of multiple objects simultaneously , mounts at the cassegrain focus ; subaru prime focus camera ( suprime-cam ) : 80-megapixel wide-field visible-light camera , mounts at the prime focus the phase i of construction is complete scexao science ready capabilities and phase ii construction to be complete by end of 2014 scexao future capabilities for science operations in 2015

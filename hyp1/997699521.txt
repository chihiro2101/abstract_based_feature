the subaru telescope is a ritchey-chretien reflecting telescope in 1985 , the astronomy committee of japan 's science council gave top priority to the development of a '' japan national large telescope '' ( jnlt ) , and in 1986 , the university of tokyo signed an agreement with the university of hawaii to build the telescope in hawaii in 1988 , the national astronomical observatory of japan was formed through a reorganization of the university 's tokyo astronomical observatory , to oversee the jnlt and other large national astronomy projects the search , split between a research group led by batygin and brown and another led by sheppard and trujillo , is expected to take up to five years several cameras and spectrographs can be mounted at subaru telescope 's four focal points for observations in visible and infrared wavelengths ; multi-object infrared camera and spectrograph ( moircs ) : wide-field camera and spectrograph with the ability to take spectra of multiple objects simultaneously , mounts at the cassegrain focus ; faint object camera and spectrograph ( focas ) : visible-light camera and spectrograph with the ability to take spectra of up to 100 objects simultaneously , mounts on the cassegrain focus ; subaru coronagraphic extreme adaptive optics ( scexao ) : the subaru coronagraphic extreme adaptive optics ( scexao ) instrument is a high-contrast imaging system for direct imaging exoplanets , 2014 , '' scexao as a precursor to an elt exoplanet direct imaging instrument '' , the system also has several other types of coronagraph : vortex , four-quadrant phase mask and 8-octant phase mask versions , and a shaped pupil coronagraph

modern data networks carry many different types of services , including voice , video , streaming music , web pages and email in december 1998 , the ietf published - definition of the differentiated services field ( ds field ) in the ipv4 and ipv6 headers , which replaced the ipv4 tos field with the ds field in the ds field , a range of eight values ( class selectors ) is used for backward compatibility with the ip precedence specification in the former tos field today , diffserv has largely supplanted tos and other layer 3 qos mechanisms , such as integrated services ( intserv ) , as the primary architecture routers use to provide qos rather than differentiating network traffic based on the requirements of an individual flow , diffserv operates on the principle of traffic classification , placing each data packet into one of a limited number of traffic classes each router on the network is then configured to differentiate traffic based on its class each traffic class can be managed differently , ensuring preferential treatment for higher-priority traffic on the network a group of routers that implement common , administratively defined diffserv policies are referred to as a diffserv domain while diffserv does recommend a standardized set of traffic classes , the diffserv architecture does not incorporate predetermined judgments of what types of traffic should be given priority treatment diffserv simply provides a framework to allow classification and differentiated treatment network traffic entering a diffserv domain is subjected to classification and conditioning for tight control over volumes and type of traffic in a given class , a network operator may choose not to honor markings at the ingress to the diffserv domain traffic in each class may be further conditioned by subjecting the traffic to rate limiting , traffic policers or shapers ef traffic is often given priority queue above all other traffic classes — a differentiated services code point ( dscp ) for capacity-admitted traffic — differentiated services quality of service policy information base

in classical physics , an effect can not occur before its cause which is why solutions such as the advanced time solutions of the liénard–wiechert potential are discarded as physically meaningless in both einstein 's theory of special and general relativity , causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause that is not in the back ( past ) light cone of that event similarly , a cause can not have an effect outside its front ( future ) light cone another requirement of causality is that cause and effect be mediated across space and time ( requirement of contiguity ) in modern physics , the notion of causality had to be clarified the insights of the theory of special relativity confirmed the assumption of causality , but they made the meaning of the word '' simultaneous '' observer-dependent consequently , the relativistic principle of causality says that the cause must precede its effect according to all inertial observers this is equivalent to the statement that the cause and its effect are separated by a timelike interval , and the effect belongs to the future of its cause new subtleties must be taken into account when we investigate causality in quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory in particular in quantum field theory , causality is closely related to the principle of locality for example , the notion that events can be ordered into causes and effects is necessary to prevent ( or at least outline ) causality paradoxes such as the grandfather paradox , which asks what happens if a time-traveler kills his own grandfather before he ever meets the time-traveler 's grandmother determinism ( or , what causality is not ) the word causality in this context means that all effects must have specific physical causes due to fundamental interactions in order to be a physical cause there must be a certain proportionality with the ensuing effect so knowing the conformal factor and the causal structure is enough to know the spacetime this article explains that faster than light signals do not necessarily lead to a violation of causality

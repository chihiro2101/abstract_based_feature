in classical physics , an effect can not occur before its cause which is why solutions such as the advanced time solutions of the liénard–wiechert potential are discarded as physically meaningless in both einstein 's theory of special and general relativity , causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause that is not in the back ( past ) light cone of that event these restrictions are consistent with the constraint that mass and energy that act as causal influences can not travel faster than the speed of light and/or backwards in time another requirement of causality is that cause and effect be mediated across space and time ( requirement of contiguity ) the insights of the theory of special relativity confirmed the assumption of causality , but they made the meaning of the word '' simultaneous '' observer-dependent consequently , the relativistic principle of causality says that the cause must precede its effect according to all inertial observers this is equivalent to the statement that the cause and its effect are separated by a timelike interval , and the effect belongs to the future of its cause if a timelike interval separates the two events , this means that a signal could be sent between them at less than the speed of light in the theory of general relativity , the concept of causality is generalized in the most straightforward way : the effect must belong to the future light cone of its cause , even if the spacetime is curved new subtleties must be taken into account when we investigate causality in quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory in particular in quantum field theory , causality is closely related to the principle of locality the empiricists ' aversion to metaphysical explanations ( like descartes ' vortex theory ) meant that scholastic arguments about what caused phenomena were either rejected for being untestable or were just ignored theories in physics like the butterfly effect from chaos theory open up the possibility of a type of distributed parameter systems in causality a related way to interpret the butterfly effect is to see it as highlighting the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a causality as represented by inus based on this , rafael sorkin proposed the idea of causal set theory , which is a fundamentally discrete approach to quantum gravity '' the transactional interpretation of quantum mechanics '' 3.10 the arrow of time in the transactional interpretation – the formalism of quantum mechanics , at least in its relativistically invariant formulation , is completely even handed in dealing with the '' arrow '' of time , the distinction between future and past time directions

in classical physics , an effect can not occur before its cause which is why solutions such as the advanced time solutions of the liénard–wiechert potential are discarded as physically meaningless in both einstein 's theory of special and general relativity , causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause that is not in the back ( past ) light cone of that event similarly , a cause can not have an effect outside its front ( future ) light cone these restrictions are consistent with the constraint that mass and energy that act as causal influences can not travel faster than the speed of light and/or backwards in time another requirement of causality is that cause and effect be mediated across space and time ( requirement of contiguity ) the insights of the theory of special relativity confirmed the assumption of causality , but they made the meaning of the word '' simultaneous '' observer-dependent consequently , the relativistic principle of causality says that the cause must precede its effect according to all inertial observers this is equivalent to the statement that the cause and its effect are separated by a timelike interval , and the effect belongs to the future of its cause in the theory of general relativity , the concept of causality is generalized in the most straightforward way : the effect must belong to the future light cone of its cause , even if the spacetime is curved new subtleties must be taken into account when we investigate causality in quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory in particular in quantum field theory , causality is closely related to the principle of locality determinism ( or , what causality is not ) the word causality in this context means that all effects must have specific physical causes due to fundamental interactions as such , in the context of causality , a force does not cause a mass to accelerate nor vice versa theories in physics like the butterfly effect from chaos theory open up the possibility of a type of distributed parameter systems in causality a related way to interpret the butterfly effect is to see it as highlighting the difference between the application of the notion of causality in physics and a causality as represented by inus

in classical physics , an effect can not occur before its cause which is why solutions such as the advanced time solutions of the liénard–wiechert potential are discarded as physically meaningless in both einstein 's theory of special and general relativity , causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause that is not in the back ( past ) light cone of that event similarly , a cause can not have an effect outside its front ( future ) light cone these restrictions are consistent with the constraint that mass and energy that act as causal influences can not travel faster than the speed of light and/or backwards in time in quantum field theory , observables of events with a spacelike relationship , '' elsewhere '' , have to commute , so the order of observations or measurements of such observables do not impact each other another requirement of causality is that cause and effect be mediated across space and time ( requirement of contiguity ) consequently , the relativistic principle of causality says that the cause must precede its effect according to all inertial observers this is equivalent to the statement that the cause and its effect are separated by a timelike interval , and the effect belongs to the future of its cause on the other hand , if signals could move faster than the speed of light , this would violate causality because it would allow a signal to be sent across spacelike intervals , which means that at least to some inertial observers the signal would travel backward in time in the theory of general relativity , the concept of causality is generalized in the most straightforward way : the effect must belong to the future light cone of its cause , even if the spacetime is curved new subtleties must be taken into account when we investigate causality in quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory in particular in quantum field theory , causality is closely related to the principle of locality the word causality in this context means that all effects must have specific physical causes due to fundamental interactions the complaint that physics does not explain the cause of phenomena has accordingly been dismissed as a problem that is ontological rather than empirical ( e.g theories in physics like the butterfly effect from chaos theory open up the possibility of a type of distributed parameter systems in causality in causal set theory , causality takes an even more prominent place

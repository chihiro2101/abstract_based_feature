in both einstein 's theory of special and general relativity , causality means that an effect can not occur from a cause that is not in the back ( past ) light cone of that event similarly , a cause can not have an effect outside its front ( future ) light cone in quantum field theory , observables of events with a spacelike relationship , '' elsewhere '' , have to commute , so the order of observations or measurements of such observables do not impact each other another requirement of causality is that cause and effect be mediated across space and time ( requirement of contiguity ) , maxwell 's electrodynamics and einstein field equations ) restoring contiguity in the transmission of influences in a more successful way than in descartes ' theory in modern physics , the notion of causality had to be clarified the insights of the theory of special relativity confirmed the assumption of causality , but they made the meaning of the word '' simultaneous '' observer-dependent consequently , the relativistic principle of causality says that the cause must precede its effect according to all inertial observers new subtleties must be taken into account when we investigate causality in quantum mechanics and relativistic quantum field theory in particular in quantum field theory , causality is closely related to the principle of locality the word causality in this context means that all effects must have specific physical causes due to fundamental interactions causality in this context is not associated with definitional principles such as newton 's second law as such , in the context of causality , a force does not cause a mass to accelerate nor vice versa the notion of force in newton 's second law was pleonasm , tautological and superfluous and , as indicated above , is not considered a consequence of any principle of causality theories in physics like the butterfly effect from chaos theory open up the possibility of a type of distributed parameter systems in causality causal processes , stanford encyclopedia of philosophy caltech tutorial on relativity â€” a nice discussion of how observers moving relatively to each other see different slices of time

there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 it is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age 3 a few authorities say it forms between ages 3–4 rather than precisely at age 3 , e.g after age three , core gender identity is extremely difficult to change , j ( a ) introduction ; ( b ) development of the ego capacity to differentiate , in the archives of sexual behavior , 1971 : '' though gender identity formation continues into young adulthood and core gender identity establishment extends into the fourth year and possibly longer , core gender identity is fairly firmly formed by age 3 this is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria '' gender identity refinement extends into the fourth to sixth years of age , stein mt , zucker kj , dixon sd barbara newmann breaks it down into four parts : ( 1 ) understanding the concept of gender , ( 2 ) learning gender role standards and stereotypes , ( 3 ) identifying with parents , and ( 4 ) forming gender preference according to un agencies , discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics , such as gender and gender identity although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood , many factors have been suggested as influencing its development in particular , the extent to which it is determined by socialization ( environmental factors ) versus innate ( biological ) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology , known as '' nature versus nurture '' biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels susan golombok , robyn fivush , gender development ( 1994 , , p 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction when children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles , they are more likely to behave in the same way , matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns language also plays a role : children , while learning a language , learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles williams , michael , '' cultural identity , language identity , gender identity '' , '' the english academy of south africa '' , 2011 the social learning theory posits that children furthermore develop their gender identity through observing and imitating gender-linked behaviors , and then being rewarded or punished for behaving that way , myers , david g john money was instrumental in the early research of gender identity , though he used the term gender role he argued that infants are born a blank slate and a parent could be able to decide their babies ’ gender in money 's opinion , if the parent confidently raised their child as the opposite sex , the child would believe that they were born that sex and act accordingly reimer grew up as a girl , dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys , but did not feel like a girl after he tried to commit suicide at age 13 , he was told that he had been born with male genitalia , which he underwent surgery to reconstruct this response went against money 's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation diamond had contributed to research involving pregnant rats that showed hormones played a major role in the behavior of different sexes the researchers in the lab would inject the pregnant rat with testosterone , which would then find its way to the baby 's bloodstream griet vandermassen argues that since these are the only two cases being documented in scientific literature , this makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions from them about the origins of gender identity , particularly given the two cases reached different conclusions however , vandermassen also argues that transgender people support the idea of gender identity as being biologically rooted , as they do not identify with their anatomical sex despite being raised and their behaviour reinforced according to their anatomical sex six of them changed their gender identity to male , five remained female and three had ambiguous gender identities ( though two of them had declared they were male )

found that a sample of androphilic trans women was shifted towards the female direction in brain responses in 1955 , john money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood , gender dysphoria and disorders of sex development ( 2013 , money 's hypothesis has since been discredited , anne fausto-sterling , sexing the

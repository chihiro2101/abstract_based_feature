there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 soraka , sociology : cultural diversity in a changing world ( ed after age three , core gender identity is extremely difficult to change , j kleeman , the establishment of core gender identity in normal girls ( a ) introduction ; ( b ) development of the ego capacity to differentiate , in the archives of sexual behavior , 1971 : '' though gender identity formation continues into young adulthood and core gender identity establishment extends into the fourth year and possibly longer , core gender identity is fairly firmly formed by age 3 this is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria '' gender identity refinement extends into the fourth to sixth years of age , stein mt , zucker kj , dixon sd 104 and continues into young adulthood barbara newmann breaks it down into four parts : ( 1 ) understanding the concept of gender , ( 2 ) learning gender role standards and stereotypes , ( 3 ) identifying with parents , and ( 4 ) forming gender preference in particular , the extent to which it is determined by socialization ( environmental factors ) versus innate ( biological ) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology , known as '' nature versus nurture '' biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction '' social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family , authority figures , mass media , and other influential people in a child 's life when children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles , they are more likely to behave in the same way , matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns john money was instrumental in the early research of gender identity , though he used the term gender role he argued that infants are born a blank slate and a parent could be able to decide their babies â€™ gender in money 's opinion , if the parent confidently raised their child as the opposite sex , the child would believe that they were born that sex and act accordingly psychologist john money convinced reimer 's parents to raise him as a girl one criticism of the reimer case is that reimer lost his penis at the age of eight months and underwent sex reassignment surgery at seventeen months , which possibly meant that reimer had already been influenced by his socialization as a boy she reported that she had been somewhat tomboyish during childhood , enjoying stereotypically masculine childhood toys and interests , although her childhood friends were girls six of them changed their gender identity to male , five remained female and three had ambiguous gender identities ( though two of them had declared they were male ) '' discordant sexual identity in some genetic males with cloacal exstrophy assigned to female sex at birth '' archives of sexual behavior 34 , no however , none of the males raised as male switched their gender identity the study 's authors caution drawing any strong conclusions from it due to numerous methodological caveats which were a severe problem in studies of this nature argue that the evidence in totality suggests that gender identity is neither determined entirely by childhood rearing nor entirely by biological factors '' gender assignment surgery on children with disorders of sex development : a case report and discussion from south africa several prenatal , biological factors , including genes and hormones , may affect gender identity a survey of the research literature from 1955 to 2000 suggests that more than one in every hundred individuals may have some intersex characteristic an intersex human or other animal is one possessing any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes , gonads , sex hormones , or genitals that , according to the un office of the high commissioner for human rights , '' do not fit typical binary notions of male or female bodies '' an intersex variation may complicate initial sex assignment and that assignment may not be consistent with the child 's future gender identity a 2005 study on the gender identity outcomes of female-raised 46 , xy persons with penile agenesis , cloacal exstrophy of the bladder , or penile ablation , found that 78 % of the study subjects were living as female , as opposed to 22 % who decided to initiate a sex change to male in line with their genetic sex the study concludes : '' the findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood , but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens concluded that gynephilic trans women had brains like men 's , but in a few areas , trans women 's brains were different from both men 's and women 's brains several studies have shown that sexually dimorphic brain structures in transsexuals are shifted away from what is associated with their birth sex and towards what is associated with their preferred sex hampson , and j , gender dysphoria and disorders of sex development ( 2013 , money 's hypothesis has since been discredited , anne fausto-sterling , sexing the body : gender politics and the construct but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation '' a 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities , as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine , feminine , or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine '' many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born , after determining the child 's sex through technology such as ultrasound these different views on gender from a child 's parents can shape the child 's understanding of gender as well as the child 's development of gender within a study conducted by hillary halpern it was hypothesized , and proven , that parent behaviors , rather than parent beliefs , regarding gender are better predictors for a child 's attitude on gender for example , mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles '' the term 'gender identity ' was used in a press release , november 21 , 1966 , to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at the johns hopkins hospital his work at johns hopkins university 's gender identity clinic ( established in 1965 ) popularized an interactionist theory of gender identity , suggesting that , up to a certain age , gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation the right to recognition before the law and principle 18 states that '' notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary , a person 's sexual orientation and gender identity are not , in and of themselves , medical conditions and are not to be treated , cured or suppressed gender identity measures have been applied in clinical assessment studies of people with gender dysphoria or intersex conditions

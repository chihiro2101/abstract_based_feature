there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 it is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age 3 after age three , core gender identity is extremely difficult to change , j kleeman , the establishment of core gender identity in normal girls coleman , developmental stages of the coming out process , in journal of homosexuality , 1982 : '' core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 ( money & ehrhardt , 1972 ) this is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria '' gender identity refinement extends into the fourth to sixth years of age , stein mt , zucker kj , dixon sd according to un agencies , discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics , such as gender and gender identity although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood , many factors have been suggested as influencing its development in particular , the extent to which it is determined by socialization ( environmental factors ) versus innate ( biological ) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology , known as '' nature versus nurture '' 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction '' social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family , authority figures , mass media , and other influential people in a child 's life when children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles , they are more likely to behave in the same way , matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns in money 's opinion , if the parent confidently raised their child as the opposite sex , the child would believe that they were born that sex and act accordingly reimer grew up as a girl , dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys , but did not feel like a girl after he tried to commit suicide at age 13 , he was told that he had been born with male genitalia , which he underwent surgery to reconstruct this response went against money 's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation milton diamond was a scientist who was one of the few to openly disagree with him and oppose his argument the researchers in the lab would inject the pregnant rat with testosterone , which would then find its way to the baby 's bloodstream the females that were born had genitalia that looked like male genitalia she reported that she had been somewhat tomboyish during childhood , enjoying stereotypically masculine childhood toys and interests , although her childhood friends were girls rowman & littlefield publishers , 2005 , pp.112-113 one study by reiner et al six of them changed their gender identity to male , five remained female and three had ambiguous gender identities ( though two of them had declared they were male ) ) , looked at males raised as females due to a variety of developmental disorders ( penile agenesis , cloacal exstrophy or penile ablation ) those still living as females still showed marked masculinisation of gender role behaviour and those old enough to reported sexual attraction to women the study 's authors caution drawing any strong conclusions from it due to numerous methodological caveats which were a severe problem in studies of this nature argue that the evidence in totality suggests that gender identity is neither determined entirely by childhood rearing nor entirely by biological factors rebelo , ethelwyn , christopher p an intersex variation may complicate initial sex assignment and that assignment may not be consistent with the child 's future gender identity concluded that gynephilic trans women had brains like men 's , but in a few areas , trans women 's brains were different from both men 's and women 's brains several studies have shown that sexually dimorphic brain structures in transsexuals are shifted away from what is associated with their birth sex and towards what is associated with their preferred sex another study suggests that transsexuality may have a genetic component male transsexual gene link found bbc news 26 october 2008 ( accessed 26 october 2008 ) research suggests that the same hormones that promote the differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth , and in a person acting and looking like their identified gender direct effects of testosterone on the developing fetal brain are of major importance for the development of male gender identity and male heterosexual orientation wallien , psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children ( 2008 ) it has been suggested that the attitudes of the child 's parents may affect the child 's gender identity , although evidence is minimal parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities , as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine , feminine , or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine '' many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born , after determining the child 's sex through technology such as ultrasound within a study conducted by hillary halpern it was hypothesized , and proven , that parent behaviors , rather than parent beliefs , regarding gender are better predictors for a child 's attitude on gender it was concluded that a mother 's behavior was especially influential on a child 's assumptions of the child 's own gender for example , mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles these gender expressions may be described as gender variant , transgender , or genderqueer ( or non-binary ) ( there is an emerging vocabulary for those who defy traditional gender identity ) , and people who have such expressions may experience gender dysphoria ( traditionally called gender identity disorder or gid ) in 1958 , the gender identity research project was established at the ucla medical center for the study of intersex and transsexual individuals this latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision , dsm-iv ( 1994 ) , which also collapsed gidc and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder 43 the '' yogyakarta principles in action '' says '' it is important to note that while 'sexual orientation ' has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries , 'gender identity ' or 'gender identity disorder ' often remains in consideration bartlett , '' what can the samoan '' fa'afafine '' teach us about the western concept of gender identity disorder in childhood ?

there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 it is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age 3 soraka , sociology : cultural diversity in a changing world ( ed after age three , core gender identity is extremely

money & ehrhardt , 1972 ) this is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria '' gender identity '' , the nurse practitioner barbara newmann breaks it down into four parts : ( 1 ) understanding the concept of gender , ( 2 ) learning gender role standards and stereotypes , ( 3 ) identifying with parents , and ( 4 ) forming gender preference according to un agencies , discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics , such as gender and gender identity although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood , many factors have been suggested as influencing its development in particular , the extent to which it is determined by socialization ( environmental factors ) versus innate ( biological ) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology , known as '' nature versus nurture '' biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction '' social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family , authority figures , mass media , and other influential people in a child 's life when children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles , they are more likely to behave in the same way , matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns john money was instrumental in the early research of gender identity , though he used the term gender role he argued that infants are born a blank slate and a parent could be able to decide their babies ’ gender in money 's opinion , if the parent confidently raised their child as the opposite sex , the child would believe that they were born that sex and act accordingly this response went against money 's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation she reported that she had been somewhat tomboyish during childhood , enjoying stereotypically masculine childhood toys and interests , although her childhood friends were girls her job at the time of the study was a blue-collar occupation that was practiced almost exclusively by men griet vandermassen argues that since these are the only two cases being documented in scientific literature , this makes it difficult to draw any firm conclusions from them about the origins of gender identity , particularly given the two cases reached different conclusions however , vandermassen also argues that transgender people support the idea of gender identity as being biologically rooted , as they do not identify with their anatomical sex despite being raised and their behaviour reinforced according to their anatomical sex six of them changed their gender identity to male , five remained female and three had ambiguous gender identities ( though two of them had declared they were male ) evidence supporting the biologic nature of gender identity however , none of the males raised as male switched their gender identity the study 's authors caution drawing any strong conclusions from it due to numerous methodological caveats which were a severe problem in studies of this nature '' gender assignment surgery on children with disorders of sex development : a case report and discussion from south africa several prenatal , biological factors , including genes and hormones , may affect gender identity an intersex variation may complicate initial sex assignment and that assignment may not be consistent with the child 's future gender identity reinforcing sex assignments through surgical and hormonal means may violate the individual 's rights at birth , 52 % of persons in the study were assigned female , and 41 % were assigned male concluded that gynephilic trans women had brains like men 's , but in a few areas , trans women 's brains were different from both men 's and women 's brains similar brain structure differences have been noted between gay and heterosexual men , and between lesbian and heterosexual women different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth , and in a person acting and looking like their identified gender , gender dysphoria and disorders of sex development ( 2013 , money 's hypothesis has since been discredited , anne fausto-sterling , sexing the body : gender politics and the construct but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation wallien , psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children ( 2008 ) it has been suggested that the attitudes of the child 's parents may affect the child 's gender identity , although evidence is minimal parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles once the child 's sex is determined , most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman , fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents when considering the parents ' social class , lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles , where the father works and the mother , who may only work out of financial necessity , still takes care of the household transgender individuals are often greatly affected by language and gender pronouns before , during , and after their transition some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity ; others retain the genitalia they were born with ( see transsexual for some of the possible reasons ) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity on this basis , he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the phallic stage , at which point gender identity became

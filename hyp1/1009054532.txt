there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 it is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age 3 a few authorities say it forms between ages 3–4 rather than precisely at age 3 , e.g after age three , core gender identity is extremely difficult to change , j kleeman , the establishment of core gender identity in normal girls coleman , developmental stages of the coming out process , in journal of homosexuality , 1982 : '' core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 ( money & ehrhardt , 1972 ) this is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria barbara newmann breaks it down into four parts : ( 1 ) understanding the concept of gender , ( 2 ) learning gender role standards and stereotypes , ( 3 ) identifying with parents , and ( 4 ) forming gender preference according to un agencies , discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics , such as gender and gender identity although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood , many factors have been suggested as influencing its development in particular , the extent to which it is determined by socialization ( environmental factors ) versus innate ( biological ) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology , known as '' nature versus nurture '' susan golombok , robyn fivush , gender development ( 1994 , , p 44 : '' when assigned and raised as boys , these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role , showing that a y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction when children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles , they are more likely to behave in the same way , matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns language also plays a role : children , while learning a language , learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles john money was instrumental in the early research of gender identity , though he used the term gender role he argued that infants are born a blank slate and a parent could be able to decide their babies ’ gender in money 's opinion , if the parent confidently raised their child as the opposite sex , the child would believe that they were born that sex and act accordingly a well-known example in the nature-versus-nurture debate is the case of david reimer , otherwise known as '' john/joan '' as a baby , reimer went through a faulty circumcision , losing his male genitalia reimer grew up as a girl , dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys , but did not feel like a girl the researchers in the lab would inject the pregnant rat with testosterone , which would then find its way to the baby 's bloodstream rowman & littlefield publishers , 2005 , pp.112-113 one study by reiner et al six of them changed their gender identity to male , five remained female and three had ambiguous gender identities ( though two of them had declared they were male ) '' discordant sexual identity in some genetic males with cloacal exstrophy assigned to female sex at birth '' gender identity outcome in female-raised 46 , xy persons with penile agenesis , cloacal exstrophy of the bladder , or penile ablation those still living as females still showed marked masculinisation of gender role behaviour and those old enough to reported sexual attraction to women '' gender assignment surgery on children with disorders of sex development : a case report and discussion from south africa several prenatal , biological factors , including genes and hormones , may affect gender identity the study concludes : '' the findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood , but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens sociological research in australia , a country with a third ' x ' sex classification , shows that 19 % of people born with atypical sex characteristics selected an '' x '' or '' other '' option , while 52 % are women , 23 % men , and 6 % unsure vilain , the endless quest for sex determination genes , clin.genet concluded that gynephilic trans women had brains like men 's , but in a few areas , trans women 's brains were different from both men 's and women 's brains different amounts of these male or female sex hormones within a person can result in behavior and external genitalia that do not match up with the norm of their sex assigned at birth , and in a person acting and looking like their identified gender in 1955 , john money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking wallien , psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children ( 2008 ) it has been suggested that the attitudes of the child 's parents may affect the child 's gender identity , although evidence is minimal parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles '' many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born , after determining the child 's sex through technology such as ultrasound the child thus is born to a gender-specific name , games , and even ambitions gender identity can lead to security issues among individuals that do not fit on a binary scale in some cases , a person 's gender identity is inconsistent with their biological sex characteristics ( genitals and secondary sex characteristics ) , resulting in individuals dressing and/or behaving in a way which is perceived by others as outside cultural gender norms some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity ; others retain the genitalia they were born with ( see transsexual for some of the possible reasons ) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity the terms gender identity and core gender identity were first used with their current meaning—one 's personal experience of one 's own gender boles , 2013 '' the term 'gender identity ' was used in a press release , november 21 , 1966 , to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at the johns hopkins hospital . gender dysphoria and

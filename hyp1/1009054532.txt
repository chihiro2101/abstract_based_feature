there are several theories about how and when gender identity forms , and studying the subject is difficult because children 's lack of language requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence john money suggested children might have awareness of and attach some significance to gender as early as 18 months to 2 years ; lawrence kohlberg argued that gender identity does not form until age 3 it is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age 3 after age three , core gender identity is extremely difficult to change , j ( a ) introduction ; ( b ) development of the ego capacity to differentiate , in the archives of sexual behavior , 1971 : '' though gender identity formation continues into young adulthood and core gender identity establishment extends into the fourth year and possibly longer , core gender identity is fairly firmly formed by age 3 this is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria '' gender identity refinement extends into the fourth to sixth years of age , stein mt , zucker kj , dixon sd barbara newmann breaks it down into four parts : ( 1 ) understanding the concept of gender , ( 2 ) learning gender role standards and stereotypes , ( 3 ) identifying with parents , and ( 4 ) forming gender preference according to un agencies , discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics , such as gender and gender identity although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood , many factors have been suggested as influencing its development in particular , the extent to which it is determined by socialization ( environmental factors ) versus innate ( biological ) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology , known as '' nature versus nurture '' both factors are thought to play a role biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels '' social factors which may influence gender identity include ideas regarding gender roles conveyed by family , authority figures , mass media , and other influential people in a child 's life when children are raised by individuals who adhere to stringent gender roles , they are more likely to behave in the same way , matching their gender identity with the corresponding stereotypical gender patterns language also plays a role : children , while learning a language , learn to separate masculine and feminine characteristics and subconsciously adjust their own behavior to these predetermined roles john money was instrumental in the early research of gender identity , though he used the term gender role he disagreed with the previous school of thought that gender was determined solely by biology as a baby , reimer went through a faulty circumcision , losing his male genitalia this response went against money 's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation the females in the litter also behaved like male rats and would even try to mount other female rats , proving that biology played a major role in animal behavior her job at the time of the study was a blue-collar occupation that was practiced almost exclusively by men looked at fourteen genetic males who had suffered cloacal exstrophy and were thus raised as girls six of them changed their gender identity to male , five remained female and three had ambiguous gender identities ( though two of them had declared they were male ) all the subjects had moderate to marked interests and attitudes consistent with that of biological males '' discordant sexual identity in some genetic males with cloacal exstrophy assigned to female sex at birth another study , meyer-bahlburg , heino fl '' gender

disorders ( penile agenesis , cloacal exstrophy or penile ablation ) those still living as females still showed marked masculinisation of gender role behaviour and those old enough to reported sexual attraction to women argue that the evidence in totality suggests that gender identity is neither determined entirely by childhood rearing nor entirely by biological factors '' gender assignment surgery on children with disorders of sex development : a case report and discussion from south africa an intersex variation may complicate initial sex assignment and that assignment may not be consistent with the child 's future gender identity the study concludes : '' the findings clearly indicate an increased risk of later patient-initiated gender re-assignment to male after female assignment in infancy or early childhood , but are nevertheless incompatible with the notion of a full determination of core gender identity by prenatal androgens sociological research in australia ,

, although evidence is minimal parental establishment of gender roles parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles once the child 's sex is determined , most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman , fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents when considering the parents ' social class , lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles , where the father works and the mother , who may only work out of financial necessity , still

were born with ( see transsexual for some of the possible reasons ) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity . gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder no one shall

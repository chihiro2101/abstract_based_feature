aiws affects the sense of vision , sensation , touch , and hearing , as well as the perception of one 's own body image migraines , nausea , dizziness , and agitation are also commonly associated symptoms with alice in wonderland syndrome within the category of lilliputian hallucinations , patients may experience either micropsia or macropsia micropsia is an abnormal visual condition , usually occurring in the context of visual hallucination , in which the affected person sees objects as being smaller than they are in reality sufferers of alice in wonderland syndrome can also often experience paranoia as a result of disturbances in sound perception a person affected by alice in wonderland syndrome may also lose a sense of time , a problem similar to the lack of spatial perspective brought on by visual distortion complete and partial forms of the alice in wonderland syndrome exist in a range of other disorders , including epilepsy , intoxicants , infectious states , fevers , and brain lesions it can also be the initial symptom of the epstein–barr virus ( see mononucleosis ) , and a relationship between the syndrome and mononucleosis has been suggested within this suggested relationship , epstein–barr virus appears to be the most common cause in children , while for adults it is more commonly associated with migraines aiws can be caused by abnormal amounts of electrical activity resulting in abnormal blood flow in the parts of the brain that process visual perception and texture nuclear medical techniques using technetium , performed on patients during episodes of alice in wonderland syndrome , have demonstrated that aiws is associated with reduced cerebral perfusion in various cortical regions ( frontal , parietal , temporal and occipital ) , both in combination and in isolation one hypothesis is that any condition resulting in a decrease in perfusion of the visual system or visual control centers of the brain may be responsible for the syndrome for example , one study used single-photon emission computed tomography to demonstrate reduced cerebral perfusion in the temporal lobe in patients with aiws other researchers suggest that metamorphopsias , or visual distortions , may be a result of reduced perfusion of the non-dominant posterior parietal lobe during migraine episodes the role of migraines in alice in wonderland syndrome is still not understood , but both vascular and electrical theories have been suggested for example , visual distortions may be a result of transient , localized ischemia ( an inadequate blood supply to an organ or part of the body ) in areas of the visual pathway during migraine attacks alice in wonderland syndrome symptoms can precede , accompany , or replace the typical migraine symptoms nonetheless , it is usually easy to rule out psychosis as those with alice in wonderland syndrome are typically aware that their hallucinations and distorted perceptions are not 'real' the average age of the start of alice in wonderland syndrome is six years old , but it is very normal for some patients to experience the syndrome from childhood up to their late 20s alice in wonderland syndrome was named after lewis carroll 's famous 19th-century novel alice 's adventures in wonderland

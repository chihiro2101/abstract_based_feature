from 1942–1964 , the bracero program allowed men with farming experience to work on us farms on a seasonal basis , and its end ushered in a new era for the development of mexico the border industrialization program ( bip ) began in 1965 and allowed for a lowering in restrictions and duties on machinery , equipment and raw materials with bip , foreign firms were able to use factories built under pronaf to import raw materials and export goods for a cheaper cost than in other countries one of the main goals of the border industrialization program was to attract foreign investment in 1989 , the federal government put in place specific procedures and requirements for maquilas under the “ maquila decree factory jobs began to leave central mexico , and workers followed the jobs from central mexico to the maquilas in the north and on the border in 1985 , maquiladoras overtook tourism as the largest source of foreign exchange , and since 1996 they have been the second largest industry in mexico behind the oil in mexico with the introduction of nafta in 1994 , northern mexico became an export processing zone corporations could use a maquila to import materials and produce a good more cheaply than in the us by paying mexican laborers to lower wages and paying less money in duties the number of factories also increased dramatically '' the devaluation of the peso in 1994 , which overnight reduced all peso-denominated manufacturing costs including energy and labor , improving the profitability of the maquiladoras , explains the growth spurt more than the changes in duties that were the result of nafta '' in the 1970s , most maquiladoras were located around the mexico & ndash ; united states border a 2011 federal reserve report indicated that the maquiladora industry affects u.s federal reserve bank of dallas , the impact of the maquiladora industry on u.s border cities , 2011 although the maquiladora industry suffered due to the early 2000s recession , maquiladoras constituted 54 % of the us-mexico trade in 2004 , and by 2005 , the maquiladora exports accounted for half of mexico 's exports since 1973 , maquiladoras have also accounted for nearly half of mexico 's export assembly between 1995 and 2000 , exports of assembled products in mexico tripled , and the rate of the industry 's growth amounted to about one new factory per day 531 by the late twentieth century , the industry accounted for 25 percent of mexico 's gross domestic product , and 17 percent of total mexican employment since globalization and physical restructuring have contributed to the competition and advent of low-cost offshore assembly in places such as china , and countries in central america , maquiladoras in mexico have been on the decline since 2000 research indicates that maquiladoras ' post-nafta growth is connected to changes in mexican wages relative to those in asia and in the united states , and to fluctuations in u.s federal reserve bank of dallas , did nafta really cause mexico 's high maquiladora growth ? , july 2001 as of 2006 , maquiladoras still accounted for 45 percent of mexico 's exports women entered the labor force in mexico in large numbers in the latter half of the 20th century between 1970 and 1995 , 18 % more women were part of the working force , and many of these women were working in maquila factories men working in maquilas were given positions of supervision , management , engineers , and technical jobs , while women were relegated to low-skill jobs however , young single women often ended up in factories with better working conditions , like the electronics plants , while older women and mothers worked in more dangerous apparel factories maquilas pay at much higher rate than the minimum wage in most markets since there is a lot of competition for the best workers , and workers will not work without transportation and other bonuses the epa 's us & ndash ; mexico border 2012 program has an extensive plan to help with environmental issues along that border piles of poisons : despite nafta ’ s green promises , hazardous waste problems are deepening in mexico no guarantees : sex discrimination in mexico ’ s maquiladora sector

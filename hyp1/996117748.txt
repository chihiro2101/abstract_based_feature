claudius was the fourth emperor of the roman empire , from ad 41 to 54 a grandson of mark antony and great-nephew of augustus , he was a member of the julio-claudian family , rome 's first imperial ruling family claudius was portrayed this way by scholars for most of history , and graves uses these peculiarities to develop a sympathetic character whose survival in a murderous dynasty depends upon his family 's incorrect assumption that he is a harmless idiot graves ' interpretation of the story owes much to the histories of gaius cornelius tacitus , plutarch , and ( especially ) suetonius ' lives of the twelve caesars graves translated suetonius before writing the novels and claimed that after reading suetonius , claudius came to him in a dream one night and demanded that his real story be told the life of claudius provided graves with a way to write about the first four emperors of rome from an intimate point of view i , claudius is written as a first-person narrative of roman history from claudius ' perspective , covering the reigns of augustus , tiberius , and caligula ; claudius the god is written as a later addition documenting claudius ' own reign the real claudius was a trained historian and is known to have written an autobiography ( now lost ) in eight books that covered the same period graves provides a theme for the story by having the fictional claudius describe a visit to cumae , where he receives a prophecy in verse from the sibyl and an additional prophecy contained in a book of '' sibylline curiosities '' the penultimate verse concerns his reign and claudius assumes that he can tell the identity of the last emperor described in the prophecy graves establishes a fatalistic tone that plays out at the end of claudius the god when claudius correctly predicts his assassination and succession by nero this enables graves ' claudius to offer explanations of latin wordplay or etymologies that would seem unnecessary if his autobiography had been written for native latin speakers writing in the first-person ( from an unspecified time period , presumably late in his own reign as emperor ) , claudius establishes himself as the author of this history of his family and insists on writing the truth , which includes harsh criticisms of the deified augustus and especially of livia claudius reveals that these untimely deaths are all the machinations of augustus ' third wife livia ( who is also claudius ' paternal grandmother ) , a calculating murderess who seeks to make her son tiberius ( claudius ' uncle ) succeed augustus as the next emperor he is eventually given a great tutor , the reputable historian athenodorus , who fosters a love of history and republican government in the young claudius postumus is eventually framed for raping claudius ' sister livilla and beating his own niece aemilia ; augustus has him banished to an island off the coast of italy , but not before postumus reveals the truth to claudius claudius then passes this on to germanicus , who convinces augustus of postumus ' innocence upon augustus ' death , tiberius is declared emperor , though his mother livia retains her power and influence as empress he sends his wife agrippina and youngest son caligula away from the military frontier and asks claudius for an enormous sum of money to pay the soldiers in the midst of this , claudius is informed that postumus is alive and secretly forming a resistance group to take back his rightful place in rome claudius ' letters to germanicus about postumus are intercepted by livia ; postumus is later captured and executed by tiberius as tiberius becomes more hated by the public , he increasingly relies on his praetorian captain sejanus to administer his edicts and punishments , who is able to manipulate tiberius into suspecting that germanicus ' wife agrippina and his own son castor are plotting to usurp the monarchy throughout claudius ' reign he is unwittingly manipulated by his adulterous wife messalina , who kills many of her enemies as well as being involved in bribery in 1976 , bbc television adapted the book and its sequel into the popular tv serial i , claudius , starring derek jacobi , si√¢n phillips , brian blessed , and john hurt in november and december 2010 , as part of the classic serial strand , bbc radio 4 broadcast a series of six hour-long episodes of a dramatisation of both novels , adapted by robin brooks and directed by jonquil panting nelson runger performed unabridged readings of both i , claudius and claudius the god for recorded books ( 1987 ) i claudia , a 2018 novel by mary mccoy was loosely based on i , claudius and translates the characters into a modern day private high school with a problematic power structure

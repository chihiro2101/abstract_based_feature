a grandson of mark antony and great-nephew of augustus , he was a member of the julio-claudian family , rome 's first imperial ruling family claudius ' family kept him out of public life until his sudden coronation at the age of fifty because of his persistent stammer , limp , and other nervous tics , which caused others to perceive him as mentally deficient and not a threat to his ambitious relatives claudius was portrayed this way by scholars for most of history , and graves uses these peculiarities to develop a sympathetic character whose survival in a murderous dynasty depends upon his family 's incorrect assumption that he is a harmless idiot graves ' interpretation of the story owes much to the histories of gaius cornelius tacitus , plutarch , and ( especially ) suetonius ' lives of the twelve caesars graves translated suetonius before writing the novels and claimed that after reading suetonius , claudius came to him in a dream one night and demanded that his real story be told the life of claudius provided graves with a way to write about the first four emperors of rome from an intimate point of view i , claudius is written as a first-person narrative of roman history from claudius ' perspective , covering the reigns of augustus , tiberius , and caligula ; claudius the god is written as a later addition documenting claudius ' own reign graves provides a theme for the story by having the fictional claudius describe a visit to cumae , where he receives a prophecy in verse from the sibyl and an additional prophecy contained in a book of '' sibylline curiosities '' graves establishes a fatalistic tone that plays out at the end of claudius the god when claudius correctly predicts his assassination and succession by nero this enables graves ' claudius to offer explanations of latin wordplay or etymologies that would seem unnecessary if his autobiography had been written for native latin speakers writing in the first-person ( from an unspecified time period , presumably late in his own reign as emperor ) , claudius establishes himself as the author of this history of his family and insists on writing the truth , which includes harsh criticisms of the deified augustus and especially of livia claudius reveals that these untimely deaths are all the machinations of augustus ' third wife livia ( who is also claudius ' paternal grandmother ) , a calculating murderess who seeks to make her son tiberius ( claudius ' uncle ) succeed augustus as the next emperor he is eventually given a great tutor , the reputable historian athenodorus , who fosters a love of history and republican government in the young claudius postumus is eventually framed for raping claudius ' sister livilla and beating his own niece aemilia ; augustus has him banished to an island off the coast of italy , but not before postumus reveals the truth to claudius claudius then passes this on to germanicus , who convinces augustus of postumus ' innocence augustus exchanges the exiled postumus with a double named clemens and secretly writes a will restoring postumus as his heir , but livia manages to discover this and poisons augustus the roman legions campaigning in germany refuse to accept the unpopular tiberius and begin to mutiny , instead declaring germanicus emperor he sends his wife agrippina and youngest son caligula away from the military frontier and asks claudius for an enormous sum of money to pay the soldiers in the midst of this , claudius is informed that postumus is alive and secretly forming a resistance group to take back his rightful place in rome claudius ' letters to germanicus about postumus are intercepted by livia ; postumus is later captured and executed by tiberius she predicts that caligula ( and not his older brothers ) will become emperor and that claudius will succeed him claudius is later invited to livia 's deathbed and reveals that caligula betrayed his promise he banishes agrippina and her son nero , while agrippina 's son drusus is imprisoned and starved to death in rome herod is in rome when caligula is assassinated and quickly is able to convince claudius to accept the emperorship in order to avoid civil war messalina is executed without claudius ' consent and claudius has no reaction during his '' olympian '' state , even bemusedly joking about being worshipped as a god in britain the three parts , or chapters , that form the trilogy are titled livia , caligula and claudius the god , and have been conceived to be performed not only sequentially , but also separately i claudia , a 2018 novel by mary mccoy was loosely based on i , claudius and translates the characters into a modern day private high school with a problematic power structure

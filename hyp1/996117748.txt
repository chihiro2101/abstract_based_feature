claudius was the fourth emperor of the roman empire , from ad 41 to 54 claudius was portrayed this way by scholars for most of history , and graves uses these peculiarities to develop a sympathetic character whose survival in a murderous dynasty depends upon his family 's incorrect assumption that he is a harmless idiot graves ' interpretation of the story owes much to the histories of gaius cornelius tacitus , plutarch , and ( especially ) suetonius ' lives of the twelve caesars graves translated suetonius before writing the novels and claimed that after reading suetonius , claudius came to him in a dream one night and demanded that his real story be told the life of claudius provided graves with a way to write about the first four emperors of rome from an intimate point of view i , claudius is written as a first-person narrative of roman history from claudius ' perspective , covering the reigns of augustus , tiberius , and caligula ; claudius the god is written as a later addition documenting claudius ' own reign the real claudius was a trained historian and is known to have written an autobiography ( now lost ) in eight books that covered the same period the penultimate verse concerns his reign and claudius assumes that he can tell the identity of the last emperor described in the prophecy graves establishes a fatalistic tone that plays out at the end of claudius the god when claudius correctly predicts his assassination and succession by nero at cumae , the sibyl tells claudius that he will '' speak clear '' this enables graves ' claudius to offer explanations of latin wordplay or etymologies that would seem unnecessary if his autobiography had been written for native latin speakers as these intrigues occur , the sickly claudius is born and is immediately shunned and mocked by his family during these early years , claudius is advised by his idol asinius pollio to play the fool to survive postumus is eventually framed for raping claudius ' sister livilla and beating his own niece aemilia ; augustus has him banished to an island off the coast of italy , but not before postumus reveals the truth to claudius he sends his wife agrippina and youngest son caligula away from the military frontier and asks claudius for an enormous sum of money to pay the soldiers claudius ' letters to germanicus about postumus are intercepted by livia ; postumus is later captured and executed by tiberius she predicts that caligula ( and not his older brothers ) will become emperor and that claudius will succeed him she privately admits to claudius to having ordered the poisonings and assassinations of many people , and then begs claudius to swear to deify her as a goddess , believing it will grant her a blissful afterlife , to which he agrees sejanus is executed along with his children ; claudius survives despite being married to sejanus ' sister , whom he quickly divorces livilla is locked in a room by her mother antonia and starved to death , and antonia punishes herself for having raised livilla by listening to her daughter die claudius quickly becomes the butt of many taunts and practical jokes by the imperial court claudius pleads that he does not want to be emperor and only wants to see the republic restored , but the guards ignore him they remain graves ' best known work , aside from his myth essay the white goddess , his english translation of the golden ass , and his own autobiography good-bye to all that an episode from '' claudius the god '' was adapted for comics in the ec comics two-fisted tales 36 , in a story titled '' battle !

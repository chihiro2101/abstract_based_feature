claudius was the fourth emperor of the roman empire , from ad 41 to 54 claudius was portrayed this way by scholars for most of history , and graves uses these peculiarities to develop a sympathetic character whose survival in a murderous dynasty depends upon his family 's incorrect assumption that he is a harmless idiot graves ' interpretation of the story owes much to the histories of gaius cornelius tacitus , plutarch , and ( especially ) suetonius ' lives of the twelve caesars graves translated suetonius before writing the novels and claimed that after reading suetonius , claudius came to him in a dream one night and demanded that his real story be told the life of claudius provided graves with a way to write about the first four emperors of rome from an intimate point of view i , claudius is written as a first-person narrative of roman history from claudius ' perspective , covering the reigns of augustus , tiberius , and caligula ; claudius the god is written as a later addition documenting claudius ' own reign the real claudius was a trained historian and is known to have written an autobiography ( now lost ) in eight books that covered the same period the penultimate verse concerns his reign and claudius assumes that he can tell the identity of the last emperor described in the prophecy graves establishes a fatalistic tone that plays out at the end of claudius the god when claudius correctly predicts his assassination and succession by nero at cumae , the sibyl tells claudius that he will '' speak clear '' claudius believes this means that his secret memoirs will one day be found and that he , having written the truth , will speak clearly , while his contemporaries , who had to distort their histories to appease the ruling family , will seem like stammerers since he wishes to record his life for posterity , claudius explains that he chooses to write in greek , which he believes will remain '' the chief literary language of the world '' this enables graves ' claudius to offer explanations of latin wordplay or etymologies that would seem unnecessary if his autobiography had been written for native latin speakers writing in the first-person ( from an unspecified time period , presumably late in his own reign as emperor ) , claudius establishes himself as the author of this history of his family and insists on writing the truth , which includes harsh criticisms of the deified augustus and especially of livia the narrative begins prior to his own birth , as he describes many of the events leading to the foundation of the roman principate and the increasingly firm emplacement of augustus as emperor despite augustus ' own publicly expressed intention to eventually restore the former republic during his prosperous reign , augustus is plagued by personal losses as his favored heirs , marcellus , marcus agrippa , gaius caesar , and lucius caesar , die claudius reveals that these untimely deaths are all the machinations of augustus ' third wife livia ( who is also claudius ' paternal grandmother ) , a calculating murderess who seeks to make her son tiberius ( claudius ' uncle ) succeed augustus as the next emperor he is eventually given a great tutor , the reputable historian athenodorus , who fosters a love of history and republican government in the young claudius postumus is eventually framed for raping claudius ' sister livilla and beating his own niece aemilia ; augustus has him banished to an island off the coast of italy , but not before postumus reveals the truth to claudius claudius then passes this on to germanicus , who convinces augustus of postumus ' innocence augustus exchanges the exiled postumus with a double named clemens and secretly writes a will restoring postumus as his heir , but livia manages to discover this and poisons augustus he sends his wife agrippina and youngest son caligula away from the military frontier and asks claudius for an enormous sum of money to pay the soldiers claudius ' letters to germanicus about postumus are intercepted by livia ; postumus is later captured and executed by tiberius livia , recognizing that claudius is a threat , sends him to carthage to prevent him from having contact with germanicus emlyn williams was cast as caligula , charles laughton was cast as claudius , and flora robson was cast as livia nelson runger performed unabridged readings of both i , claudius and claudius the god for recorded books ( 1987 ) the three parts , or chapters , that form the trilogy are titled livia , caligula and claudius the god , and have been conceived to be performed not only sequentially , but also separately

the most basic form of platform consists of an area at the same level as the track , usually resulting in a fairly large height difference between the platform and the train floor the more traditional platform is elevated relative to the track but often lower than the train floor , although ideally they should be at the same level occasionally the platform is higher than the train floor , where a train with a low floor serves a station built for trains with a high floor , for example at the dutch stations of the db regionalbahn westfalen ( see a tram stop is often in the middle of the street ; usually it has as a platform a refuge area of a similar height to that of the sidewalk , e.g a railway station may be served by heavy-rail and light-rail vehicles with lower floors and have a dual- height platform , as on the rijngouwelijn in the netherlands platform types include the bay platform , side platform ( also called through platform ) , split platform and island platform an island platform has through platforms on both sides ; it may be indented on one or both ends , with bay platforms a variant on the side platform is the spanish solution which has platforms on both sides of a single through track at platforms 3 through to 12 are split along their length with odd numbered platforms facing north and east and even facing south and west , with a small signal halfway along the platform therefore , an island platform would be described as one platform with two tracks where the platforms are not adjacent to a station building , often some form of shelter or waiting room is provided , and employee cabins may also be present some metro stations have platform screen doors between the platforms and the tracks also passenger carriages are straight , so doors will not always open directly onto a curved platform & ndash ; often a platform gap is present

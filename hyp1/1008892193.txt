the most basic form of platform consists of an area at the same level as the track , usually resulting in a fairly large height difference between the platform and the train floor the more traditional platform is elevated relative to the track but often lower than the train floor , although ideally they should be at the same level occasionally the platform is higher than the train floor , where a train with a low floor serves a station built for trains with a high floor , for example at the dutch stations of the db regionalbahn westfalen ( see on the london underground some stations are served by both district line and piccadilly line trains , and the piccadilly trains have lower floors a tram stop is often in the middle of the street ; usually it has as a platform a refuge area of a similar height to that of the sidewalk , e.g a railway station may be served by heavy-rail and light-rail vehicles with lower floors and have a dual- height platform , as on the rijngouwelijn in the netherlands platform types include the bay platform , side platform ( also called through platform ) , split platform and island platform the term '' platform '' is also used in the us but refers to the structure rather than a designated place for a train arriving therefore , an island platform would be described as one platform with two tracks '' the train is arriving at platform 5 '' ) many platforms have a cavity underneath an cantilever so that people who may fall off the platform can seek shelter from incoming trains in united kingdom , a guideline for platform safety specifies that for the platforms with train passing speeds between and , there should be a yellow-line buffer zone of and other warning signs also passenger carriages are straight , so doors will not always open directly onto a curved platform & ndash ; often a platform gap is present

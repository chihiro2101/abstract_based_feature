because fuel is not injected into the combustion chamber until just before the combustion is required to begin , there is little risk of engine knocking the engine can also run on a much leaner overall air/fuel ratio , using stratified charge , in which a small charge of a rich fuel mixture is ignited first and used to improve combustion of a larger charge of a lean fuel mixture combustion can be problematic if a lean mixture is present at the spark plug however , fueling a petrol engine directly allows more fuel to be directed towards the spark-plug than elsewhere in the combustion-chamber charge stratification can also be achieved where there is no 'in cylinder ' stratification : the inlet mixture can be so lean that it is unable to be ignited by the limited energy provided by a conventional spark plug this exceptionally lean mixture can , however , be ignited by the use of a conventional mixture strength of 12-15:1 , in the case of a petrol fuelled engine , being fed into a small combustion chamber adjacent to and connected to the main lean-mixture chamber it can be seen from this method of charge stratification that the lean charge is 'burnt ' and the engine utilising this form of stratification is no longer subject to ' knock ' or uncontrolled combustion petrol can burn faster than diesel fuel , allowing higher maximum engine speeds and thus greater maximum power for sporting engines most petrol engines were carbureted , sucking the fuel/air mixture into the engine , while the diesel only sucked in air and the fuel was directly injected at high pressure into the cylinder the fuel is now injected into the cylinder and the fuel ' burn ' or expansion is started at this point by the high temperature of the , now compressed , air '' another part reads '' i have for the first time , so far as my knowledge extends , regulated speed by variably controlling the direct discharge of liquid fuel into the combustion chamber or cylinder into a finely-divided condition highly favorable to immediate combustion '' harry ricardo first began working with the idea of a lean burn '' stratified charge '' engine in the early 1900s this strategy makes for an air-fuel mix within the chamber that is much leaner than with a conventional homogeneous-charge system that fills the chamber more uniformly before combustion turbo fuel stratified injection ( tfsi ) is a trademark of the volkswagen group for a type of forced-aspiration ( '' turbo '' ) engine where the fuel is pressure-injected straight into the combustion chamber in such a way as to create a stratified charge

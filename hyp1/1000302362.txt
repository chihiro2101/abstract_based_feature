a higher mechanical compression ratio , or dynamic compression ratio with forced induction , can be used to improve thermodynamic efficiency because fuel is not injected into the combustion chamber until just before the combustion is required to begin , there is little risk of engine knocking the engine can also run on a much leaner overall air/fuel ratio , using stratified charge , in which a small charge of a rich fuel mixture is ignited first and used to improve combustion of a larger charge of a lean fuel mixture these zones are not usually present in a gasoline engine , because the air and fuel is better mixed this results in a stratified charge : one in which the air/fuel ratio is not homogeneous throughout the combustion-chamber , but varies in a controlled ( and potentially quite complex ) way across the volume of the cylinder it can be seen from this method of charge stratification that the lean charge is 'burnt ' and the engine utilising this form of stratification is no longer subject to ' knock ' or uncontrolled combustion petrol can burn faster than diesel fuel , allowing higher maximum engine speeds and thus greater maximum power for sporting engines diesel fuel , on the other hand , has a higher energy density , and in combination with higher combustion pressures can deliver very strong torque and high thermodynamic efficiency for more '' normal '' road vehicles most petrol engines were carbureted , sucking the fuel/air mixture into the engine , while the diesel only sucked in air and the fuel was directly injected at high pressure into the cylinder in the conventional four-stroke petrol engine the spark plug commences to ignite the mixture in the cylinder at up to forty degrees before top dead centre while the piston is still travelling up the bore the principle of injecting fuel directly into the combustion chamber at the moment at which combustion is required to start was first invented by george brayton in 1887 , but it has been used to good effect in petrol engines for a long time ( so called high efficiency ) version , which fit in the jaguar xj12 and jaguar xjs models and used a stratified charge design called the 'may fireball ' in order to reduce the engine 's very heavy fuel consumption with the stratified-charge application , the 3.0l v-6 will continue to employ direct fuel injection , but the injectors have been redesigned to spray under higher pressure later in the intake stroke , just before compression , and the fuel is shaped to arrive in certain areas within the cylinder to optimize combustion turbo fuel stratified injection ( tfsi ) is a trademark of the volkswagen group for a type of forced-aspiration ( '' turbo '' ) engine where the fuel is pressure-injected straight into the combustion chamber in such a way as to create a stratified charge

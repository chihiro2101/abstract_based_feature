a higher mechanical compression ratio , or dynamic compression ratio with forced induction , can be used to improve thermodynamic efficiency because fuel is not injected into the combustion chamber until just before the combustion is required to begin , there is little risk of engine knocking the engine can also run on a much leaner overall air/fuel ratio , using stratified charge , in which a small charge of a rich fuel mixture is ignited first and used to improve combustion of a larger charge of a lean fuel mixture disadvantages include : increased injector cost and complexity higher fuel pressure requirements carbon build-up on the back of the intake valve due to the lack of gasoline passing by the intake valve to act as a cleaning agent for the valve on traditional multi-port injection designs increased no x formation , due to the presence of extremely lean zones these zones are not usually present in a gasoline engine , because the air and fuel is better mixed however , fueling a petrol engine directly allows more fuel to be directed towards the spark-plug than elsewhere in the combustion-chamber this results in a stratified charge : one in which the air/fuel ratio is not homogeneous throughout the combustion-chamber , but varies in a controlled ( and potentially quite complex ) way across the volume of the cylinder charge stratification can also be achieved where there is no 'in cylinder ' stratification : the inlet mixture can be so lean that it is unable to be ignited by the limited energy provided by a conventional spark plug it can be seen from this method of charge stratification that the lean charge is 'burnt ' and the engine utilising this form of stratification is no longer subject to ' knock ' or uncontrolled combustion most petrol engines were carbureted , sucking the fuel/air mixture into the engine , while the diesel only sucked in air and the fuel was directly injected at high pressure into the cylinder the fuel is now injected into the cylinder and the fuel ' burn ' or expansion is started at this point by the high temperature of the , now compressed , air volkswagen currently uses stratified charge on its direct injection 1.2 , 1.4 , 1.5 , 1.8 and 2.0 litres tfsi ( turbo fuel stratified injection ) gasoline engines , in combination with turbocharging turbo fuel stratified injection ( tfsi ) is a trademark of the volkswagen group for a type of forced-aspiration ( '' turbo '' ) engine where the fuel is pressure-injected straight into the combustion chamber in such a way as to create a stratified charge more expensive - much higher pressure fuel pumps are required to inject the fuel directly into the cylinder

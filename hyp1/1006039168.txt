many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny this period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the madelung rule elements and their properties rubidium is the first element placed in period 5 it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements for example , rubidium has 5 electron shells , a property found in all other period 5 elements , whereas its electron configuration 's ending is similar to all other alkali metals : s 1 strontium is the second element placed in the 5th period like rubidium , it has 5 electron shells or energy levels , and in accordance with the madelung rule it has two electrons in its 5s subshell strontium is a soft metal and is extremely reactive upon contact with water yttrium is a chemical element with symbol y and atomic number 39 it is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a '' rare earth element '' yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element yttrium has no known biological role , and exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number 40 zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier , although minor amounts are used as alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion niobium , or columbium , is a chemical element with the symbol nb and atomic number 41 niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum , and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish the english chemistcharles hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 , and named it columbium the german chemist heinrich rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element , which he named niobium it was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially brazil is the leading producer of niobium and ferroniobium , an alloy of niobium and iron niobium is used mostly in alloys , the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines niobium is used in various superconducting materials these type-ii superconductor , also containing titanium and tin , are widely used in the superconducting magnets of mri scanners molybdenum is a group 6 chemical element with the symbol mo and atomic number 42 the free element , which is a silvery metal , has the sixth-highest melting point of any element industrially , molybdenum compounds are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications , as pigments and catalysis it is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes ; every form of it is radioactive nearly all technetium is produced synthetically and only minute amounts are found in nature naturally occurring technetium occurs as a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or by neutron capture in molybdenum ores the chemical properties of this silvery gray , crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese ruthenium is a chemical element with symbol ru and atomic number 44 rhodium is a chemical element that is a rare , silvery-white , hard , and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal , alloyed with similar metals , and never as a chemical compound rhodium detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure the neutron detection indium is a chemical element with the symbol in and atomic number 49 antimony is a toxic chemical element with the symbol sb and an atomic number of 51 applications in solar panels and as a semiconductor material also consume a considerable fraction of tellurium production xenon is a chemical element with the symbol xe and atomic number 54 rubidium , strontium , yttrium , zirconium , and niobium have no biological role xenon has no biological role , and is used as a general anaesthesia

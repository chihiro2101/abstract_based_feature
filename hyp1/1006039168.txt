many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny this period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the madelung rule elements and their properties it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements for example , rubidium has 5 electron shells , a property found in all other period 5 elements , whereas its electron configuration 's ending is similar to all other alkali metals : s 1 rubidium also follows the trend of increasing reactivity as the atomic number increases in the alkali metals , for it is more reactive than potassium , but less so than caesium in addition , both potassium and rubidium yield almost the same hue when ignited , so researchers must use different methods to differentiate between these two 1st group elements rubidium is very susceptible to redox in air , similar to most of the other alkali metals , so it readily transforms into rubidium oxide , a yellow solid with the chemical formula rb 2 o it is an alkaline earth metal , a relatively reactive group , although not nearly as reactive as the alkali metals like rubidium , it has 5 electron shells or energy levels , and in accordance with the madelung rule it has two electrons in its 5s subshell strontium is a soft metal and is extremely reactive upon contact with water in addition , strontium , like rubidium , redox in air and turns a yellow color yttrium is a chemical element with symbol y and atomic number 39 elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by friedrich wöhler yttrium has no known biological role , and exposure to yttrium compounds can cause lung disease in humans zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number 40 it is a lustrous , gray-white , strong transition metal that resembles titanium niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum , and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish the english chemistcharles hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 , and named it columbium niobium is used mostly in alloys , the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines other applications of niobium include its use in welding , nuclear industries , electronics , optics , numismatics and jewelry molybdenum is a group 6 chemical element with the symbol mo and atomic number 42 most molybdenum compounds have low solubility in water , but the molybdate ion moo 4 2− is soluble and forms when molybdenum-containing minerals are in contact with oxygen and water technetium is the chemical element with atomic number 43 and symbol tc nearly all technetium is produced synthetically and only minute amounts are found in nature naturally occurring technetium occurs as a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or by neutron capture in molybdenum ores the chemical properties of this silvery gray , crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name ekamanganese ( em ) it has the chemical symbol rh and atomic number 45 naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal , alloyed with similar metals , and never as a chemical compound palladium , platinum , rhodium , ruthenium , iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals ( pgms ) a quarter of all goods manufactured today either contain pgms or have a significant part in their manufacturing process played by pgms silver is a metallic chemical element with the chemical symbol ag , from the indo-european root arg- for '' grey '' or '' shining '' ) and atomic number 47 this soft , bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12 , zinc and mercury this rare , very soft , malleable and easily fusible other metal is chemically similar to gallium and thallium , and shows the intermediate properties between these two the metal was first isolated in the following year tin is a chemical element with the symbol sn ( for and atomic number 50 a brittle , mildly toxic , rare , silver-white metalloid which looks similar to tin , tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur iodine and its compounds are primarily used in nutrition , and industrially in the production of acetic acid and certain polymers a colorless , heavy , odorless noble gas , xenon occurs in the earth 's atmosphere in trace amounts xenon is also being used to search for hypothetical weakly interacting massive particles and as the propellant for ion thrusters in spacecraft

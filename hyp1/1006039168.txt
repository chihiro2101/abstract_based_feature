zirconium is one of the main components of zircon crystals , currently the oldest known minerals in the earth 's crust many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny this period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the madelung rule elements and their properties rubidium is the first element placed in period 5 it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements for example , rubidium has 5 electron shells , a property found in all other period 5 elements , whereas its electron configuration 's ending is similar to all other alkali metals : s 1 rubidium also follows the trend of increasing reactivity as the atomic number increases in the alkali metals , for it is more reactive than potassium , but less so than caesium in addition , both potassium and rubidium yield almost the same hue when ignited , so researchers must use different methods to differentiate between these two 1st group elements strontium is the second element placed in the 5th period it is an alkaline earth metal , a relatively reactive group , although not nearly as reactive as the alkali metals like rubidium , it has 5 electron shells or energy levels , and in accordance with the madelung rule it has two electrons in its 5s subshell in addition , strontium , like rubidium , redox in air and turns a yellow color it is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a '' rare earth element '' yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element elemental yttrium was first isolated in 1828 by friedrich w√∂hler zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number 40 zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier , although minor amounts are used as alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion niobium , or columbium , is a chemical element with the symbol nb and atomic number 41 it is a soft , grey , ductile transition metal , which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral , the main commercial source for niobium , and columbite niobium has physical and chemical properties similar to those of the element tantalum , and the two are therefore difficult to distinguish the german chemist heinrich rose determined in 1846 that tantalum ores contain a second element , which he named niobium in 1864 and 1865 , a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element ( as distinguished from tantalum ) , and for a century both names were used interchangeably it was not until the early 20th century that niobium was first used commercially niobium is used mostly in alloys , the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines molybdenum is a group 6 chemical element with the symbol mo and atomic number 42 it readily forms hard , stable carbides , and for this reason it is often used in high-strength steel alloys technetium is the chemical element with atomic number 43 and symbol tc it is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes ; every form of it is radioactive mendeleev noted a gap in his periodic table and gave the undiscovered element the provisional name ekamanganese ( em ) in 1937 technetium ( specifically the technetium-97 isotope ) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced , hence its name ( from the greek , meaning '' artificial '' ) ruthenium is a chemical element with symbol ru and atomic number 44 it has the chemical symbol rh and atomic number 45 rhodium detectors are used in nuclear reactors to measure the neutron detection palladium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol pd and an atomic number of 46 it is a rare and lustrous silvery-white metal discovered in 1803 by william hyde wollaston palladium , platinum , rhodium , ruthenium , iridium and osmium form a group of elements referred to as the platinum group metals ( pgms ) tin is a chemical element with the symbol sn ( for and atomic number 50 for some time china has been the largest producer of antimony and its compounds , with most production coming from the xikuangshan mine in hunan tellurium is a chemical element that has the symbol te and atomic number 52 technetium , ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , silver , tin , and antimony have no biological role

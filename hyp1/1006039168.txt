zirconium is one of the main components of zircon crystals , currently the oldest known minerals in the earth 's crust many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny this period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the madelung rule rubidium is the first element placed in period 5 it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements for example , rubidium has 5 electron shells , a property found in all other period 5 elements , whereas its electron configuration 's ending is similar to all other alkali metals : s 1 rubidium also follows the trend of increasing reactivity as the atomic number increases in the alkali metals , for it is more reactive than potassium , but less so than caesium in addition , both potassium and rubidium yield almost the same hue when ignited , so researchers must use different methods to differentiate between these two 1st group elements rubidium is very susceptible to redox in air , similar to most of the other alkali metals , so it readily transforms into rubidium oxide , a yellow solid with the chemical formula rb 2 o like rubidium , it has 5 electron shells or energy levels , and in accordance with the madelung rule it has two electrons in its 5s subshell yttrium is a chemical element with symbol y and atomic number 39 in 1787 , carl axel arrhenius found a new mineral near ytterby in sweden and named it ytterbite , after the village zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number 40 zirconium is mainly used as a refractory and opacifier , although minor amounts are used as alloying agent for its strong resistance to corrosion zirconium forms a variety of inorganic and organometallic compounds such as zirconium dioxide and zirconocene dichloride , respectively niobium , or columbium , is a chemical element with the symbol nb and atomic number 41 it is a soft , grey , ductile transition metal , which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral , the main commercial source for niobium , and columbite the english chemistcharles hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 , and named it columbium niobium is used mostly in alloys , the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines these type-ii superconductor , also containing titanium and tin , are widely used in the superconducting magnets of mri scanners in the last two applications , niobium 's low toxicity and ability to be colored by anodizing are particular advantages molybdenum is a group 6 chemical element with the symbol mo and atomic number 42 the free element , which is a silvery metal , has the sixth-highest melting point of any element molybdenum does not occur as a free metal on earth , but rather in various oxidation states in minerals technetium is the chemical element with atomic number 43 and symbol tc naturally occurring technetium occurs as a spontaneous fission product in uranium ore or by neutron capture in molybdenum ores the chemical properties of this silvery gray , crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese in 1937 technetium ( specifically the technetium-97 isotope ) became the first predominantly artificial element to be produced , hence its name ( from the greek , meaning '' artificial '' ) its short-lived gamma ray-emitting nuclear isomer—technetium-99m—is used in nuclear medicine for a wide variety of diagnostic tests rhodium is a chemical element that is a rare , silvery-white , hard , and chemically inert transition metal and a member of the platinum group it has the chemical symbol rh and atomic number 45 naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal , alloyed with similar metals , and never as a chemical compound the element 's major use ( about 80 % of world rhodium production ) is as one of the catalysts in the catalytic converter three-way of automobiles because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals , and because of its rarity , rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings palladium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol pd and an atomic number of 46 a quarter of all goods manufactured today either contain pgms or have a significant part in their manufacturing process played by pgms the metal occurs naturally in its pure , free form ( native silver ) , as an alloy with gold and other metals , and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite indium was discovered in 1863 and named for the indigo blue line in its spectrum that was the first indication of its existence in zinc ores , as a new and unknown element tin is a chemical element with the symbol sn ( for and atomic number 50 tin shows chemical similarity to both neighboring group 14 elements , germanium and lead and has two possible oxidation states , +2 and the slightly more stable +4 like the other halogens , free iodine occurs mainly as a diatomic molecule i 2 , and then only momentarily after being oxidized from iodide by an oxidant like free oxygen

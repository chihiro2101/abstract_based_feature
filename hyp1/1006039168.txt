zirconium is one of the main components of zircon crystals , currently the oldest known minerals in the earth 's crust many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny rubidium is the first element placed in period 5 it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements it is an alkaline earth metal , a relatively reactive group , although not nearly as reactive as the alkali metals like rubidium , it has 5 electron shells or energy levels , and in accordance with the madelung rule it has two electrons in its 5s subshell strontium is a soft metal and is extremely reactive upon contact with water if it does come in contact with water , though , it will combine with the atoms of both oxygen and hydrogen to form strontium hydroxide and pure hydrogen gas which quickly diffuses in the air yttrium is a chemical element with symbol y and atomic number 39 it is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a '' rare earth element '' yttrium is almost always found combined with the lanthanides in rare earth minerals and is never found in nature as a free element zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number 40 niobium , or columbium , is a chemical element with the symbol nb and atomic number 41 the english chemistcharles hatchett reported a new element similar to tantalum in 1801 , and named it columbium niobium is used mostly in alloys , the largest part in special steel such as that used in gas pipelines other applications of niobium include its use in welding , nuclear industries , electronics , optics , numismatics and jewelry it readily forms hard , stable carbides , and for this reason it is often used in high-strength steel alloys industrially , molybdenum compounds are used in high-pressure and high-temperature applications , as pigments and catalysis it is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes ; every form of it is radioactive the chemical properties of this silvery gray , crystalline transition metal are intermediate between rhenium and manganese technetium-99 is used as a gamma ray-free source of beta particles long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods ruthenium is a chemical element with symbol ru and atomic number 44 like the other metals of the platinum group , ruthenium is inert to most chemicals it has the chemical symbol rh and atomic number 45 naturally occurring rhodium is found as the free metal , alloyed with similar metals , and never as a chemical compound palladium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol pd and an atomic number of 46 the unique properties of palladium and other platinum group metals account for their widespread use the numerous applications and limited supply sources of palladium result in the metal attracting considerable investment interest silver is a metallic chemical element with the chemical symbol ag , from the indo-european root arg- for '' grey '' or '' shining '' ) and atomic number 47 the metal occurs naturally in its pure , free form ( native silver ) , as an alloy with gold and other metals , and in minerals such as argentite and chlorargyrite with the exception of its use in nickelâ€“cadmium battery and cadmium telluride solar panels , the use of cadmium is generally decreasing these declines have been due to competing technologies , cadmium 's toxicity in certain forms and concentration and resulting regulations indium is a chemical element with the symbol in and atomic number 49 indium was discovered in 1863 and named for the indigo blue line in its spectrum that was the first indication of its existence in zinc ores , as a new and unknown element very rarely the element can be found as grains of native ( free ) metal , but these are not of commercial importance tin is a chemical element with the symbol sn ( for and atomic number 50 the firstalloy , used in large scale since 3000 bc , was bronze , an alloy of tin and copper iodine is a chemical element with the symbol i and atomic number 53 in the universe and on earth , iodine 's high atomic number makes it a relatively rare element rubidium , strontium , yttrium , zirconium , and niobium have no biological role

this period contains technetium , one of the two elements until lead that has no stable isotopes ( along with promethium ) , as well as molybdenum and iodine , two of the heaviest elements with a known biological role , and niobium has the largest magnetic known penetration depth of all the elements zirconium is one of the main components of zircon crystals , currently the oldest known minerals in the earth 's crust many later transition metals , such as rhodium , are very commonly used in jewelry due to the fact that they are incredibly shiny this period is known to have a large number of exceptions to the madelung rule rubidium is the first element placed in period 5 it is an alkali metal , the most reactive group in the periodic table , having properties and similarities with both other alkali metals and other period 5 elements for example , rubidium has 5 electron shells , a property found in all other period 5 elements , whereas its electron configuration 's ending is similar to all other alkali metals : s 1 rubidium also follows the trend of increasing reactivity as the atomic number increases in the alkali metals , for it is more reactive than potassium , but less so than caesium in addition , both potassium and rubidium yield almost the same hue when ignited , so researchers must use different methods to differentiate between these two 1st group elements rubidium is very susceptible to redox in air , similar to most of the other alkali metals , so it readily transforms into rubidium oxide , a yellow solid with the chemical formula rb 2 o strontium is the second element placed in the 5th period like rubidium , it has 5 electron shells or energy levels , and in accordance with the madelung rule it has two electrons in its 5s subshell yttrium is a chemical element with symbol y and atomic number 39 it is a silvery-metallic transition metal chemically similar to the lanthanides and it has often been classified as a '' rare earth element '' in 1787 , carl axel arrhenius found a new mineral near ytterby in sweden and named it ytterbite , after the village johan gadolin discovered yttrium 's oxide in arrhenius ' sample in 1789 , yttrium krogt and anders gustaf ekeberg named the new oxide yttria zirconium is a chemical element with the symbol zr and atomic number 40 niobium , or columbium , is a chemical element with the symbol nb and atomic number 41 it is a soft , grey , ductile transition metal , which is often found in the pyrochlore mineral , the main commercial source for niobium , and columbite in 1809 , the english chemist william hyde wollaston wrongly concluded that tantalum and columbium were identical in 1864 and 1865 , a series of scientific findings clarified that niobium and columbium were the same element ( as distinguished from tantalum ) , and for a century both names were used interchangeably other applications of niobium include its use in welding , nuclear industries , electronics , optics , numismatics and jewelry molybdenum is a group 6 chemical element with the symbol mo and atomic number 42 it readily forms hard , stable carbides , and for this reason it is often used in high-strength steel alloys technetium is the chemical element with atomic number 43 and symbol tc it is the lowest atomic number element without any stable isotopes ; every form of it is radioactive many of technetium 's properties were predicted by dmitri mendeleev before the element was discovered long-lived technetium isotopes produced commercially are by-products of fission of uranium-235 in nuclear reactors and are extracted from nuclear fuel rods because no isotope of technetium has a half-life longer than 4.2 & nbsp ; million years ( technetium-98 ) , its detection in red giants in 1952 , which are billions of years old , helped bolster the theory that stars can produce heavier elements because rhodium metal is inert against corrosion and most aggressive chemicals , and because of its rarity , rhodium is usually alloyed with platinum or palladium and applied in high-temperature and corrosion-resistive coatings palladium is a chemical element with the chemical symbol pd and an atomic number of 46 palladium plays a key role in the technology used for fuel cells , which combine hydrogen and oxygen to produce electricity , heat , and water most silver is produced as a byproduct of copper , gold , lead , and zinc refining silver has long been valued as a precious metal , and it is used to make ornaments , jewelry , high-value tableware , utensils ( hence the term silverware ) , and currency coins its compounds are used in photographic film , and dilute silver nitrate solutions and other silver compounds are used as disinfectants and microbiocides this soft , bluish-white metal is chemically similar to the two other stable metals in group 12 , zinc and mercury pewter , which is an alloy of 85â€“90 % tin with the remainder commonly consisting of copper , antimony and lead , was used for tableware from the bronze age until the 20th century applications in solar panels and as a semiconductor material also consume a considerable fraction of tellurium production iodine is a chemical element with the symbol i and atomic number 53 radioactive xenon-135 is produced from iodine-135 as a result of nuclear fission , and it acts as the most significant neutron absorber in nuclear reactors technetium , ruthenium , rhodium , palladium , silver , tin , and antimony have no biological role

a classic expression of this position is found in maimonides ' guide to the perplexed , according to maimonides , then , there can be no plurality of faculties , moral dispositions , or essential attributes in god even to say that god is all-knowing , all-powerful , and all-good is to introduce plurality , if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that god 's power is greater than ours , that god 's life is more permanent than ours , or that god 's knowledge is broader than ours maimonedes believed that statements such as '' god lives '' or '' god is powerful '' are nonsense if they are interpreted in the normal fashion , but they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations citing psalm 65 , maimonides concludes that the highest form of praise we can give god is silence some identify divine simplicity as a corollary of creationism : '' in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth '' ( genesis 1:1 ) god , as creator is by definition separate from the universe and thus free of any property ( and hence an absolute unity ) ; see negative theology for others , conversely , the axiom of divine unity ( see shema yisrael ) informs the understanding of divine simplicity on the one hand , god is absolutely simple , containing no element of form or structure , as above on the other hand , it is understood that god 's essence contains every possible element of perfection : '' the first foundation is to believe in the existence of the creator , blessed be he god is without the sort of metaphysical complexity where god would have different parts which are distinct from himself ( property simplicity ) in other words , property simplicity ( or metaphysical simplicity ) states that the characteristics of god are not parts of god that together make up god god is simple ; god is those characteristics spatial simplicity is endorsed by the vast majority of traditional christian theists ( who do not consider god to be a physical object ) feinberg , thomas morris , william lane craig , and alvin plantinga , who in his essay does god have a nature ? calls it '' a dark saying indeed plantinga gives three arguments against divine simplicity first , he argues our concepts can apply univocally to god , even if our language to describe god is limited , fragmentary , halting , and inchoate if none of our concepts apply to god , then it is sheer confusion to say there is such a person as god , and yet god does not have properties such as wisdom , being the creator , and being almighty if we can not rely on our usual modes of inference in reasoning about god , we can not argue for the conclusion that god is not distinct from his properties first , the thomist doctrine of simplicity states that all abstract objects are identical with god 's essence and hence god himself metaphysical simplicity claims that there is no divine composition , meaning that there is no complexity of properties in god and that he is identical with his nature and each of his properties if god is a property , then he is n't a person but a mere abstract object , having no power , life , love , or even awareness on the doctrine of divine simplicity , god is absolutely similar in all possible worlds this does n't mean that god has physical parts , but that the implications of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity are too problematic to maintain the doctrine 3 '' on the simplicity of god ''

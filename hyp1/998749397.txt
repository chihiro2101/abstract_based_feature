even to say that god is all-knowing , all-powerful , and all-good is to introduce plurality , if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that god 's power is greater than ours , that god 's life is more permanent than ours , or that god 's knowledge is broader than ours maimonedes believed that statements such as '' god lives '' or '' god is powerful '' are nonsense if they are interpreted in the normal fashion , but they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations some identify divine simplicity as a corollary of creationism : '' in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth '' ( genesis 1:1 ) god , as creator is by definition separate from the universe and thus free of any property ( and hence an absolute unity ) ; see negative theology on the one hand , god is absolutely simple , containing no element of form or structure , as above on the other hand , it is understood that god 's essence contains every possible element of perfection : '' the first foundation is to believe in the existence of the creator , blessed be he in other words , property simplicity ( or metaphysical simplicity ) states that the characteristics of god are not parts of god that together make up god god is simple ; god is those characteristics spatial simplicity is endorsed by the vast majority of traditional christian theists ( who do not consider god to be a physical object ) morris describes property simplicity as the property of having no properties , and this area is more controversial still theologians holding the doctrine of property simplicity tend to distinguish various modes of the simple being of god by negating any notion of composition from the meaning of terms used to describe it thus , in quantitative or spatial terms , god is simple as opposed to being made up of pieces , present in entirety everywhere , if in fact present anywhere in terms of essences , god is simple as opposed to being made up of form and matter , or body and soul , or mind and act , and so on god 's essence is ineffability ; this likeness is nevertheless truly comparable to god who simply is goodness , because humanity is a complex being composed by god '' in the image and likeness of god the concept applies to an object if that object is , in fact , a horse god would not even have properties such as existing , being self-identical , or even being the referent of the term 'god ' if god transcends human experience , then we can not say something univocal about god , since such a claim presupposes that we know what it means to transcend human experience , and that it applies to god if we can not use univocal language to describe god and argue against simplicity , we are equally handicapped when it comes to the arguments for divine simplicity first , the thomist doctrine of simplicity states that all abstract objects are identical with god 's essence and hence god himself secondly , plantinga argues , if one restricts the realm of abstract objects that are identical with god to only the properties that god exemplifies , the doctrine is still problematic metaphysical simplicity states that god has no accidental ( i.e secondly , if god is identical with his properties , then , since each of god 's properties is a property , it follows that god is a property as well god without parts : divine simplicity and the metaphysics of god 's absoluteness 3 '' on the simplicity of god ''

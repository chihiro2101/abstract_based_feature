a classic expression of this position is found in maimonides ' guide to the perplexed , according to maimonides , then , there can be no plurality of faculties , moral dispositions , or essential attributes in god even to say that god is all-knowing , all-powerful , and all-good is to introduce plurality , if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that god 's power is greater than ours , that god 's life is more permanent than ours , or that god 's knowledge is broader than ours maimonedes believed that statements such as '' god lives '' or '' god is powerful '' are nonsense if they are interpreted in the normal fashion , but they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations some identify divine simplicity as a corollary of creationism : '' in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth '' ( genesis 1:1 ) for others , conversely , the axiom of divine unity ( see shema yisrael ) informs the understanding of divine simplicity he develops this idea to show that an entity which is truly one must be free of properties and thus indescribable – and unlike anything else ( additionally such an entity would be absolutely unsubject to change , as well as utterly independent and the root of everything ) despite its apparent simplicity , this concept is recognised as raising many difficulties in particular , insofar as god 's simplicity does not allow for any structure & mdash ; even conceptually & mdash ; divine simplicity appears to entail the following dichotomy on the other hand , it is understood that god 's essence contains every possible element of perfection : '' the first foundation is to believe in the existence of the creator , blessed be he it is this dimension which makes it possible for us to speak of god ’ s multifaceted relationship to the universe without violating the basic principle of his unity and simplicity ” ( aryeh kaplan , innerspace ) god is without the sort of metaphysical complexity where god would have different parts which are distinct from himself ( property simplicity ) in other words , property simplicity ( or metaphysical simplicity ) states that the characteristics of god are not parts of god that together make up god god is simple ; god is those characteristics thus , in quantitative or spatial terms , god is simple as opposed to being made up of pieces , present in entirety everywhere , if in fact present anywhere consequently , when christian scripture is interpreted according to the guide of divine simplicity , when it says that god is good for example , it should be taken to speak of a likeness to goodness as found in humanity and referred to in human speech god 's essence is ineffability ; this likeness is nevertheless truly comparable to god who simply is goodness , because humanity is a complex being composed by god '' in the image and likeness of god ' if god transcends human experience , then we can not say something univocal about god , since such a claim presupposes that we know what it means to transcend human experience , and that it applies to god plantinga concludes '' this way of thinking begins in a pious and commendable concern for god 's greatness and majesty and augustness , but it ends in agnosticism and in incoherence first , the thomist doctrine of simplicity states that all abstract objects are identical with god 's essence and hence god himself secondly , plantinga argues , if one restricts the realm of abstract objects that are identical with god to only the properties that god exemplifies , the doctrine is still problematic on the doctrine of divine simplicity , god is absolutely similar in all possible worlds god without parts : divine simplicity and the metaphysics of god 's absoluteness '' trinity , simplicity and the status of god 's personal relations '' , international journal of systematic theology 16 ( 1 ) ( 2014 ) : 79–98

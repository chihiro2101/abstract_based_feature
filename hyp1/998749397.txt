even to say that god is all-knowing , all-powerful , and all-good is to introduce plurality , if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that god 's power is greater than ours , that god 's life is more permanent than ours , or that god 's knowledge is broader than ours maimonedes believed that statements such as '' god lives '' or '' god is powerful '' are nonsense if they are interpreted in the normal fashion , but they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations still , maimonedes also believed that negation is objectionable to the degree that it introduces complexity : god is neither this nor that , and ultimately any kind of verbal expression fails us some identify divine simplicity as a corollary of creationism : '' in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth '' ( genesis 1:1 ) god , as creator is by definition separate from the universe and thus free of any property ( and hence an absolute unity ) ; see negative theology for others , conversely , the axiom of divine unity ( see shema yisrael ) informs the understanding of divine simplicity thomas morris notes that divine simplicity can mean any or all of three different claims : god has no spatial parts ( spatial simplicity ) god is without the sort of metaphysical complexity where god would have different parts which are distinct from himself ( property simplicity ) in other words , property simplicity ( or metaphysical simplicity ) states that the characteristics of god are not parts of god that together make up god spatial simplicity is endorsed by the vast majority of traditional christian theists ( who do not consider god to be a physical object ) temporal simplicity is endorsed by many theists but is highly controversial among christian theologians morris describes property simplicity as the property of having no properties , and this area is more controversial still theologians holding the doctrine of property simplicity tend to distinguish various modes of the simple being of god by negating any notion of composition from the meaning of terms used to describe it consequently , when christian scripture is interpreted according to the guide of divine simplicity , when it says that god is good for example , it should be taken to speak of a likeness to goodness as found in humanity and referred to in human speech god 's essence is ineffability ; this likeness is nevertheless truly comparable to god who simply is goodness , because humanity is a complex being composed by god '' in the image and likeness of god if none of our concepts apply to god , then it is sheer confusion to say there is such a person as god , and yet god does not have properties such as wisdom , being the creator , and being almighty god would not even have properties such as existing , being self-identical , or even being the referent of the term 'god if we can not rely on our usual modes of inference in reasoning about god , we can not argue for the conclusion that god is not distinct from his properties plantinga states that this seems to clash with the obvious fact that the property of being a horse is distinct from the property of being a turkey and both are distinct from god and his essence if so , there is at least one individual essence such that god does not now have , but will have the characteristic of causing that essence to be instantiated metaphysical simplicity claims that there is no divine composition , meaning that there is no complexity of properties in god and that he is identical with his nature and each of his properties secondly , if god is identical with his properties , then , since each of god 's properties is a property , it follows that god is a property as well by postulating a distinction between existence and essence for all created beings , which was perceived to be uniquely absent in god , al-farabi established another model of divine simplicity 3 '' on the simplicity of god ''

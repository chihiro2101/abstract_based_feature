even to say that god is all-knowing , all-powerful , and all-good is to introduce plurality , if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that god 's power is greater than ours , that god 's life is more permanent than ours , or that god 's knowledge is broader than ours still , maimonedes also believed that negation is objectionable to the degree that it introduces complexity : god is neither this nor that , and ultimately any kind of verbal expression fails us some identify divine simplicity as a corollary of creationism : '' in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth '' ( genesis 1:1 ) for others , conversely , the axiom of divine unity ( see shema yisrael ) informs the understanding of divine simplicity in particular , insofar as god 's simplicity does not allow for any structure & mdash ; even conceptually & mdash ; divine simplicity appears to entail the following dichotomy on the one hand , god is absolutely simple , containing no element of form or structure , as above on the other hand , it is understood that god 's essence contains every possible element of perfection : '' the first foundation is to believe in the existence of the creator , blessed be he this means that there exists a being that is perfect ( complete ) in all ways and he is the cause of all else that exists in western christian classical theism , god is simple , not composite , not made up of thing upon thing thomas morris notes that divine simplicity can mean any or all of three different claims : god has no spatial parts ( spatial simplicity ) god is without the sort of metaphysical complexity where god would have different parts which are distinct from himself ( property simplicity ) in other words , property simplicity ( or metaphysical simplicity ) states that the characteristics of god are not parts of god that together make up god god is simple ; god is those characteristics spatial simplicity is endorsed by the vast majority of traditional christian theists ( who do not consider god to be a physical object ) temporal simplicity is endorsed by many theists but is highly controversial among christian theologians in terms of essences , god is simple as opposed to being made up of form and matter , or body and soul , or mind and act , and so on consequently , when christian scripture is interpreted according to the guide of divine simplicity , when it says that god is good for example , it should be taken to speak of a likeness to goodness as found in humanity and referred to in human speech first , he argues our concepts can apply univocally to god , even if our language to describe god is limited , fragmentary , halting , and inchoate plantinga states that this seems to clash with the obvious fact that the property of being a horse is distinct from the property of being a turkey and both are distinct from god and his essence secondly , plantinga argues , if one restricts the realm of abstract objects that are identical with god to only the properties that god exemplifies , the doctrine is still problematic if so , there is at least one individual essence such that god does not now have , but will have the characteristic of causing that essence to be instantiated first , if god is identical with each of his properties , then each of his properties is identical with each of his other properties , so god has only one property by postulating a distinction between existence and essence for all created beings , which was perceived to be uniquely absent in god , al-farabi established another model of divine simplicity god without parts : divine simplicity and the metaphysics of god 's absoluteness

a classic expression of this position is found in maimonides ' guide to the perplexed , according to maimonides , then , there can be no plurality of faculties , moral dispositions , or essential attributes in god even to say that god is all-knowing , all-powerful , and all-good is to introduce plurality , if one means thereby that these qualities are separate attributes maimonides therefore concludes that it is not true to say that god 's power is greater than ours , that god 's life is more permanent than ours , or that god 's knowledge is broader than ours maimonedes believed that statements such as '' god lives '' or '' god is powerful '' are nonsense if they are interpreted in the normal fashion , but they can be understood if one analyzes them as disguised negations some identify divine simplicity as a corollary of creationism : '' in the beginning god created the heaven and the earth '' ( genesis 1:1 ) god , as creator is by definition separate from the universe and thus free of any property ( and hence an absolute unity ) ; see negative theology for others , conversely , the axiom of divine unity ( see shema yisrael ) informs the understanding of divine simplicity in particular , insofar as god 's simplicity does not allow for any structure & mdash ; even conceptually & mdash ; divine simplicity appears to entail the following dichotomy on the other hand , it is understood that god 's essence contains every possible element of perfection : '' the first foundation is to believe in the existence of the creator , blessed be he in western christian classical theism , god is simple , not composite , not made up of thing upon thing thomas morris notes that divine simplicity can mean any or all of three different claims : god has no spatial parts ( spatial simplicity ) god is without the sort of metaphysical complexity where god would have different parts which are distinct from himself ( property simplicity ) spatial simplicity is endorsed by the vast majority of traditional christian theists ( who do not consider god to be a physical object ) morris describes property simplicity as the property of having no properties , and this area is more controversial still theologians holding the doctrine of property simplicity tend to distinguish various modes of the simple being of god by negating any notion of composition from the meaning of terms used to describe it if distinctions are made when speaking of god 's attributes , they are distinctions of the '' modes '' of god 's being , rather than real or essential divisions god 's essence is ineffability ; this likeness is nevertheless truly comparable to god who simply is goodness , because humanity is a complex being composed by god '' in the image and likeness of god if none of our concepts apply to god , then it is sheer confusion to say there is such a person as god , and yet god does not have properties such as wisdom , being the creator , and being almighty ' if god transcends human experience , then we can not say something univocal about god , since such a claim presupposes that we know what it means to transcend human experience , and that it applies to god plantinga concludes '' this way of thinking begins in a pious and commendable concern for god 's greatness and majesty and augustness , but it ends in agnosticism and in incoherence '' plantinga also gives three criticisms of the doctrine of metaphysical simplicity directly , stating that it is exceedingly hard to grasp or construe the doctrine , and it is difficult to see why anyone would be inclined to accept it secondly , plantinga argues , if one restricts the realm of abstract objects that are identical with god to only the properties that god exemplifies , the doctrine is still problematic metaphysical simplicity claims that there is no divine composition , meaning that there is no complexity of properties in god and that he is identical with his nature and each of his properties by postulating a distinction between existence and essence for all created beings , which was perceived to be uniquely absent in god , al-farabi established another model of divine simplicity 3 '' on the simplicity of god ''

adam smith , in his seminal work the wealth of nations , described wealth as '' the annual produce of the land and labour of the society '' in popular usage , wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic value , or the state of controlling or possessing such items , usually in the form of money , real estate and personal property an individual who is considered wealthy , affluent , or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group in economics , net worth refers to the value of assets owned minus the value of liabilities owed at a point in time all these delineations make wealth an especially important part of social stratification when a desirable or valuable commodity ( transferable good or skill ) is abundantly available to everyone , the owner of the commodity will possess no potential for wealth when a valuable or desirable commodity is in scarce supply , the owner of the commodity will possess great potential for wealth 'wealth ' refers to some accumulation of resources ( net asset value ) , whether abundant or not a wealthy individual , community , or nation thus has more accumulated resources ( capital ) than a poor one a personal net worth of us 10,000 in most parts of the united states would certainly not place a person among the wealthiest citizens of that locale concepts of wealth also vary across time this comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future ; given this trend of human advancement , it is possible that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations however , physical capital , as it came to be known , consisting of both the natural capital and the infrastructural capital , became the focus of the analysis of wealth adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials , labour , land , and technology in such a way as to capture a profit ( excess above the cost of production ) marxian economics ( see labor theory of value ) distinguishes in the grundrisse between material wealth and human wealth , defining human wealth as '' wealth in human relations '' ; land and labour were the source of all material wealth having a leading position in the development of rational sciences , in new technologies and in economic production leads to wealth , while the opposite can be correlated with poverty in that way , money also enables a new type of economic society and the definition of wealth in measurable quantities , such as gold and money in economics , wealth ( in a commonly applied accounting sense , sometimes savings ) is the net worth of a person , household , or nation – that is , the value of all assets owned net of all liabilities owed at a point in time for national wealth as measured in the national accounts , the net liabilities are those owed to the rest of the world '' social accounting , '' the new palgrave : a dictionary of economics , v the wealth of nations wealth or savings is a stock variable – that is , it is measurable at a date in time , for example the value of an orchard on december 31 minus debt owed on the orchard what marks the income as a flow is its measurement per unit of time , such as the value of apples yielded from the orchard per year in macroeconomic theory the 'wealth effect ' may refer to the increase in aggregate consumption from an increase in national wealth one feature of its effect on economic behavior is the wealth elasticity of demand , which is the percentage change in the amount of consumption goods demanded for each one-percent change in wealth wealth may be measured in nominal or real values – that is , in money value as of a given date or adjusted to net out price changes but analysis may adapt typical accounting conventions for economic purposes in social accounting ( such as in national accounts ) wealth and social class social class is not identical to wealth , but the two concepts are related ( particularly in marxist theory ) , leading to the combined concept of socioeconomic status financial assets such as stocks and bonds , which can be traded for cash , also contribute to wealth wealth is a restrictive agent for people of different classes because some hobbies can only be participated in by the affluent , such as world travel the way the various social classes in society view wealth vary and these diverse characteristics are a fundamental dividing line among the classes in 2013 , 1 % of adults were estimated to hold 46 % of world wealth global wealth report 2013 and around 18.5 trillion was estimated to be stored in tax havens worldwide adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials , labour , land , and technology in such a way as to capture a profit ( excess above the cost of production )

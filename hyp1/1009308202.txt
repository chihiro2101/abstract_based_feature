adam smith , in his seminal work the wealth of nations , described wealth as '' the annual produce of the land and labour of the society '' in popular usage , wealth can be described as an abundance of items of economic value , or the state of controlling or possessing such items , usually in the form of money , real estate and personal property an individual who is considered wealthy , affluent , or rich is someone who has accumulated substantial wealth relative to others in their society or reference group in economics , net worth refers to the value of assets owned minus the value of liabilities owed at a point in time wealth provides a type of individual safety net of protection against an unforeseen decline in one 's living standard in the event of job loss or other emergency and can be transformed into home ownership , business ownership , or even a college education wealth has been defined as a collection of things limited in supply , transferable , and useful in satisfying human desires when a desirable or valuable commodity ( transferable good or skill ) is abundantly available to everyone , the owner of the commodity will possess no potential for wealth 'wealth ' refers to some accumulation of resources ( net asset value ) , whether abundant or not the term implies a social contract on establishing and maintaining ownership in relation to such items which can be invoked with little or no effort and expense on the part of the owner however , such an amount would constitute an extraordinary amount of wealth in impoverished developing country concepts of wealth also vary across time this comparative wealth across time is also applicable to the future ; given this trend of human advancement , it is possible that the standard of living that the wealthiest enjoy today will be considered impoverished by future generations however , physical capital , as it came to be known , consisting of both the natural capital and the infrastructural capital , became the focus of the analysis of wealth adam smith saw wealth creation as the combination of materials , labour , land , and technology in such a way as to capture a profit ( excess above the cost of production ) an inquiry into the nature and causes of the wealth of nations the theories of david ricardo , john locke , john stuart mill , in the 18th century and 19th century built on these views of wealth that we now call classical economics marxian economics ( see labor theory of value ) distinguishes in the grundrisse between material wealth and human wealth , defining human wealth as '' wealth in human relations '' ;

although beta blockers were once contraindicated in congestive heart failure , as they have the potential to worsen the condition due to their effect of decreasing cardiac contractility , studies in the late 1990s showed their efficacy at reducing morbidity and mortality bisoprolol , carvedilol , and sustained-release metoprolol are specifically indicated as adjuncts to standard ace inhibitor and diuretic therapy in congestive heart failure , although at doses typically much lower than those indicated for other conditions beta-blockers are only indicated in cases of compensated , stable congestive heart failure ; in cases of acute decompensated heart failure , beta-blockers will cause a further decrease in ejection fraction , worsening the patient 's current symptoms beta-blockers are known primarily for their reductive effect on heart rate , although this is not the only mechanism of action of importance in congestive heart failure beta-blockers , in addition to their sympatholytic β1 activity in the heart , influence the renin–angiotensin system at the kidneys beta-blockers cause a decrease in renin secretion , which in turn reduces the heart oxygen demand by lowering the extracellular volume and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood beta-blockers counter this inappropriately high sympathetic activity , eventually leading to an improved ejection fraction , despite an initial reduction in ejection fraction however , many controlled trials in the past 25 years indicate beta blockers are effective in anxiety disorders , though the mechanism of action is not known the application to stage fright was first recognized in the lancet in 1976 , and by 1987 , a survey conducted by the international conference of symphony orchestra musicians , representing the 51 largest orchestras in the united states , revealed 27 % of its musicians had used beta-blockers and 70 % obtained them from friends , not physicians the use of beta blockers around the time of cardiac surgery decreases the risk of heart dysrhythmias due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier , lipophilic beta blockers , such as propranolol and metoprolol , are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances , such as insomnia , vivid dreams and nightmares hypoglycemia can occur with beta blockade because β2-adrenoceptors normally stimulate glycogen breakdown ( glycogenolysis ) in the liver and pancreatic release of the hormone glucagon , which work together to increase plasma glucose β1-blockers have fewer metabolic side effects in diabetic patients ; however , the fast heart rate that serves as a warning sign for insulin-induced low blood sugar may be masked , resulting in hypoglycemia unawareness beta-adrenoceptor antagonists ( beta-blockers ) ; a 2007 study revealed diuretics and beta blockers used for hypertension increase a patient 's risk of developing diabetes mellitus , while ace inhibitors and angiotensin ii receptor antagonists ( angiotensin receptor blockers ) actually decrease the risk of diabetes clinical guidelines in great britain , but not in the united states , call for avoiding diuretics and beta blockers as first-line treatment of hypertension due to the risk of diabetes beta blockers with lipophilic properties and cns penetration such as metoprolol and labetalol may be useful for treating cns and cardiovascular toxicity from a methamphetamine overdose the phenomenon of '' unopposed alpha stimulation '' has not been reported with the use of beta blockers for treatment of methamphetamine toxicity the 2007 national heart , lung , and blood institute ( nhlbi ) asthma guidelines recommend against the use of non-selective beta blockers in asthmatics , while allowing for the use of cardioselective beta blockers people experiencing bronchospasm due to the β 2 receptor-blocking effects of nonselective beta blockers may be treated with anticholinergic drugs , such as ipratropium , which are safer than beta agonists in patients with cardiovascular disease the primary antihypertensive mechanism of beta blockers is unclear , but may involve reduction in cardiac output ( due to negative chronotropic and inotropic effects ) β 1 -selective beta blockers are also known as cardioselective beta blockers also , a 2017 meta-analysis failed to show any benefit for the use of beta blockers in breast cancer beta blockers have also been used for the treatment of schizoid personality disorder

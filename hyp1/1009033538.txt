although beta blockers were once contraindicated in congestive heart failure , as they have the potential to worsen the condition due to their effect of decreasing cardiac contractility , studies in the late 1990s showed their efficacy at reducing morbidity and mortality bisoprolol , carvedilol , and sustained-release metoprolol are specifically indicated as adjuncts to standard ace inhibitor and diuretic therapy in congestive heart failure , although at doses typically much lower than those indicated for other conditions beta-blockers are only indicated in cases of compensated , stable congestive heart failure ; in cases of acute decompensated heart failure , beta-blockers will cause a further decrease in ejection fraction , worsening the patient 's current symptoms beta-blockers are known primarily for their reductive effect on heart rate , although this is not the only mechanism of action of importance in congestive heart failure beta-blockers , in addition to their sympatholytic β1 activity in the heart , influence the renin–angiotensin system at the kidneys beta-blockers cause a decrease in renin secretion , which in turn reduces the heart oxygen demand by lowering the extracellular volume and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood the heart of the patient must adjust to decreasing stimulation by catecholamines and find a new equilibrium at a lower adrenergic drive however , many controlled trials in the past 25 years indicate beta blockers are effective in anxiety disorders , though the mechanism of action is not known musicians , public speakers , actors , and professional dancers have been known to use beta-blockers to avoid performance anxiety , stage fright , and tremor during both auditions and public performances the use of beta blockers around the time of cardiac surgery decreases the risk of heart dysrhythmias because they promote lower heart rates and reduce tremors , beta blockers have been used in professional sports where high accuracy is required , including archery , shooting , golf and snooker due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier , lipophilic beta blockers , such as propranolol and metoprolol , are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances , such as insomnia , vivid dreams and nightmares clinical guidelines in great britain , but not in the united states , call for avoiding diuretics and beta blockers as first-line treatment of hypertension due to the risk of diabetes the blockade of only beta receptors increases hypertension , reduces coronary blood flow , left ventricular function , and cardiac output and tissue perfusion by means of leaving the alpha-adrenergic system stimulation unopposed the mixed alpha- and beta blocker labetalol is especially useful for treatment of concomitant tachycardia and hypertension induced by methamphetamine the 2007 national heart , lung , and blood institute ( nhlbi ) asthma guidelines recommend against the use of non-selective beta blockers in asthmatics , while allowing for the use of cardioselective beta blockers unless a pacemaker is present , beta-blockers can severely depress conduction in the av node , resulting in a reduction of heart rate and cardiac output usage of beta-blockers in tachycardic patients with wolff-parkinson-white syndrome can result in severe bradycardia , necessitating treatment with a pacemaker since β 2 adrenergic receptors can cause vascular smooth muscle dilation , beta blockers may cause some vasoconstriction the primary antihypertensive mechanism of beta blockers is unclear , but may involve reduction in cardiac output ( due to negative chronotropic and inotropic effects ) negative chronotropic properties of beta-blockers allow the lifesaving property of heart rate control β 1 -selective beta blockers are also known as cardioselective beta blockers beta blockers have also been used for the treatment of schizoid personality disorder

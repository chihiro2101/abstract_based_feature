although beta blockers were once contraindicated in congestive heart failure , as they have the potential to worsen the condition due to their effect of decreasing cardiac contractility , studies in the late 1990s showed their efficacy at reducing morbidity and mortality bisoprolol , carvedilol , and sustained-release metoprolol are specifically indicated as adjuncts to standard ace inhibitor and diuretic therapy in congestive heart failure , although at doses typically much lower than those indicated for other conditions beta-blockers are only indicated in cases of compensated , stable congestive heart failure ; in cases of acute decompensated heart failure , beta-blockers will cause a further decrease in ejection fraction , worsening the patient 's current symptoms beta-blockers are known primarily for their reductive effect on heart rate , although this is not the only mechanism of action of importance in congestive heart failure beta-blockers cause a decrease in renin secretion , which in turn reduces the heart oxygen demand by lowering the extracellular volume and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood trials have shown beta blockers reduce the absolute risk of death by 4.5 % over a 13-month period however , many controlled trials in the past 25 years indicate beta blockers are effective in anxiety disorders , though the mechanism of action is not known the application to stage fright was first recognized in the lancet in 1976 , and by 1987 , a survey conducted by the international conference of symphony orchestra musicians , representing the 51 largest orchestras in the united states , revealed 27 % of its musicians had used beta-blockers and 70 % obtained them from friends , not physicians the use of beta blockers around the time of cardiac surgery decreases the risk of heart dysrhythmias because they promote lower heart rates and reduce tremors , beta blockers have been used in professional sports where high accuracy is required , including archery , shooting , golf and snooker due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier , lipophilic beta blockers , such as propranolol and metoprolol , are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances , such as insomnia , vivid dreams and nightmares beta blockade , especially of the beta-1 receptor at the macula densa , inhibits renin release , thus decreasing the release of aldosterone hypoglycemia can occur with beta blockade because β2-adrenoceptors normally stimulate glycogen breakdown ( glycogenolysis ) in the liver and pancreatic release of the hormone glucagon , which work together to increase plasma glucose β1-blockers have fewer metabolic side effects in diabetic patients ; however , the fast heart rate that serves as a warning sign for insulin-induced low blood sugar may be masked , resulting in hypoglycemia unawareness clinical guidelines in great britain , but not in the united states , call for avoiding diuretics and beta blockers as first-line treatment of hypertension due to the risk of diabetes the blockade of only beta receptors increases hypertension , reduces coronary blood flow , left ventricular function , and cardiac output and tissue perfusion by means of leaving the alpha-adrenergic system stimulation unopposed beta blockers with lipophilic properties and cns penetration such as metoprolol and labetalol may be useful for treating cns and cardiovascular toxicity from a methamphetamine overdose the mixed alpha- and beta blocker labetalol is especially useful for treatment of concomitant tachycardia and hypertension induced by methamphetamine the 2007 national heart , lung , and blood institute ( nhlbi ) asthma guidelines recommend against the use of non-selective beta blockers in asthmatics , while allowing for the use of cardioselective beta blockers beta-blockers ' inhibition on epinephrine 's effect can somewhat exacerbate hypoglycemia by interfering with glycogenesis and mask signs of hypoglycemia such as tachycardia , palpitations , diaphoresis , and tremors the primary antihypertensive mechanism of beta blockers is unclear , but may involve reduction in cardiac output ( due to negative chronotropic and inotropic effects ) β 1 -selective beta blockers are also known as cardioselective beta blockers beta blockers have also been used for the treatment of schizoid personality disorder

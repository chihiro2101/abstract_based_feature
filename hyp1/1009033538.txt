although beta blockers were once contraindicated in congestive heart failure , as they have the potential to worsen the condition due to their effect of decreasing cardiac contractility , studies in the late 1990s showed their efficacy at reducing morbidity and mortality beta-blockers are only indicated in cases of compensated , stable congestive heart failure ; in cases of acute decompensated heart failure , beta-blockers will cause a further decrease in ejection fraction , worsening the patient 's current symptoms beta-blockers are known primarily for their reductive effect on heart rate , although this is not the only mechanism of action of importance in congestive heart failure beta-blockers cause a decrease in renin secretion , which in turn reduces the heart oxygen demand by lowering the extracellular volume and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood beta-blockers counter this inappropriately high sympathetic activity , eventually leading to an improved ejection fraction , despite an initial reduction in ejection fraction trials have shown beta blockers reduce the absolute risk of death by 4.5 % over a 13-month period however , many controlled trials in the past 25 years indicate beta blockers are effective in anxiety disorders , though the mechanism of action is not known the use of beta blockers around the time of cardiac surgery decreases the risk of heart dysrhythmias because they promote lower heart rates and reduce tremors , beta blockers have been used in professional sports where high accuracy is required , including archery , shooting , golf and snooker for similar reasons , beta blockers have also been used by surgeons due to the high penetration across the blood–brain barrier , lipophilic beta blockers , such as propranolol and metoprolol , are more likely than other less lipophilic beta blockers to cause sleep disturbances , such as insomnia , vivid dreams and nightmares beta blockade , especially of the beta-1 receptor at the macula densa , inhibits renin release , thus decreasing the release of aldosterone beta blockers must not be used in the treatment of selective alpha-adrenergic agonist overdose the blockade of only beta receptors increases hypertension , reduces coronary blood flow , left ventricular function , and cardiac output and tissue perfusion by means of leaving the alpha-adrenergic system stimulation unopposed beta blockers with lipophilic properties and cns penetration such as metoprolol and labetalol may be useful for treating cns and cardiovascular toxicity from a methamphetamine overdose the mixed alpha- and beta blocker labetalol is especially useful for treatment of concomitant tachycardia and hypertension induced by methamphetamine the phenomenon of '' unopposed alpha stimulation '' has not been reported with the use of beta blockers for treatment of methamphetamine toxicity unless a pacemaker is present , beta-blockers can severely depress conduction in the av node , resulting in a reduction of heart rate and cardiac output glucagon , used in the treatment of overdose , increases the strength of heart contractions , increases intracellular camp , and decreases renal vascular resistance it may also be due to reduction in renin release from the kidneys , and a central nervous system effect to reduce sympathetic activity ( for those beta blockers that do cross the blood–brain barrier , e.g β 1 -selective beta blockers are also known as cardioselective beta blockers beta blockers , due to their antagonism at beta-1 adrenergic receptors , inhibit both the synthesis of new melatonin and its secretion by the pineal gland beta blockers have also been used for the treatment of schizoid personality disorder

although beta blockers were once contraindicated in congestive heart failure , as they have the potential to worsen the condition due to their effect of decreasing cardiac contractility , studies in the late 1990s showed their efficacy at reducing morbidity and mortality bisoprolol , carvedilol , and sustained-release metoprolol are specifically indicated as adjuncts to standard ace inhibitor and diuretic therapy in congestive heart failure , although at doses typically much lower than those indicated for other conditions beta-blockers are only indicated in cases of compensated , stable congestive heart failure ; in cases of acute decompensated heart failure , beta-blockers will cause a further decrease in ejection fraction , worsening the patient 's current symptoms beta-blockers are known primarily for their reductive effect on heart rate , although this is not the only mechanism of action of importance in congestive heart failure beta-blockers , in addition to their sympatholytic β1 activity in the heart , influence the renin–angiotensin system at the kidneys beta-blockers cause a decrease in renin secretion , which in turn reduces the heart oxygen demand by lowering the extracellular volume and increasing the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood beta-blockers counter this inappropriately high sympathetic activity , eventually leading to an improved ejection fraction , despite an initial reduction in ejection fraction in addition to reducing the risk of mortality , the numbers of hospital visits and hospitalizations were also reduced in the trials therapeutic administration of beta-blockers for congestive heart failure ought to begin at very low doses ( 1/8 of target ) with a gradual escalation of the dose the heart of the patient must adjust to decreasing stimulation by catecholamines and find a new equilibrium at a lower adrenergic drive however , many controlled trials in the past 25 years indicate beta blockers are effective in anxiety disorders , though the mechanism of action is not known musicians , public speakers , actors , and professional dancers have been known to use beta-blockers to avoid performance anxiety , stage fright , and tremor during both auditions and public performances the blockade of only beta receptors increases hypertension , reduces coronary blood flow , left ventricular function , and cardiac output and tissue perfusion by means of leaving the alpha-adrenergic system stimulation unopposed beta blockers with lipophilic properties and cns penetration such as metoprolol and labetalol may be useful for treating cns and cardiovascular toxicity from a methamphetamine overdose the mixed alpha- and beta blocker labetalol is especially useful for treatment of concomitant tachycardia and hypertension induced by methamphetamine the 2007 national heart , lung , and blood institute ( nhlbi ) asthma guidelines recommend against the use of non-selective beta blockers in asthmatics , while allowing for the use of cardioselective beta blockers beta-blockers ' inhibition on epinephrine 's effect can somewhat exacerbate hypoglycemia by interfering with glycogenesis and mask signs of hypoglycemia such as tachycardia , palpitations , diaphoresis , and tremors unless a pacemaker is present , beta-blockers can severely depress conduction in the av node , resulting in a reduction of heart rate and cardiac output usage of beta-blockers in tachycardic patients with wolff-parkinson-white syndrome can result in severe bradycardia , necessitating treatment with a pacemaker glucagon , used in the treatment of overdose , increases the strength of heart contractions , increases intracellular camp , and decreases renal vascular resistance agents with isa are not used after myocardial infarctions , as they have not been demonstrated to be beneficial , labetalol and carvedilol ) exhibit mixed antagonism of both β- and α 1 -adrenergic receptors , which provides additional arteriole vasodilating action beta blockers have also been used for the treatment of schizoid personality disorder

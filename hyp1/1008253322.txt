each wikipedia article is in a process of evolution and is likely to continue growing an article longer than one or two pages when printed should be divided into sections to ease navigation ( see wikipedia : manual of style and wikipedia : layout for guidance ) readers of the mobile version of wikipedia can be helped by ensuring that sections are not so long or so numerous as to impede navigation at 10,000 words ( 50 & nbsp ; kb and above ) it may be beneficial to move some sections to other articles and replace them with summaries per wikipedia : summary style â€“ see a rule of thumb below while expert readers of such articles may accept complexity and length provided the article is well written , the general reader requires clarity and conciseness there are times when a long or very long article is unavoidable , though its complexity should be minimized readable prose is the main body of the text , excluding material such as footnotes and reference sections ( '' see also '' , '' external links '' , bibliography , etc if there is no '' natural '' way to split or reduce a long list or table , it may be best to leave it intact , and a decision made to either keep it embedded in the main article or split it off into a stand-alone page some large articles exist for topics that require depth and detail , but typically articles of such size are split into two or more smaller articles the maximum limit for wikipedia is set by the mediawiki software default article size limit , 2048 kibibytes ( specifically , 2,097,152 bytes ) in the independent article , put the or tag on the talk page to create a banner that refers back to the main article ) a note should also be made in the edit summary of the source article , '' split content to article name '' , to protect against the article subsequently being deleted and the history of the new page eradicated a relatively trivial topic may be appropriate in the context of the larger article , but inappropriate as the topic of an entire article in itself if a section of an article is a magnet for unhelpful contributions ( such as the '' external links '' section or trivia sections ) , be aware that while moving it to another article may help to clean up the main article , it creates a new article that consists entirely of a section for unwanted contributions content , especially summary , well sourced and non-tangential information , should not be removed from articles simply to reduce length ; see wikipedia : content removal reasons for acceptable reasons also the search box entry : intitle : article title will show both number of words in the article and the size of the article in kilobytes often you can edit the article one section at a time by using the '' edit '' links you see next to each header in the article

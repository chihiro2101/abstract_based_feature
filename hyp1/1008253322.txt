each wikipedia article is in a process of evolution and is likely to continue growing an article longer than one or two pages when printed should be divided into sections to ease navigation ( see wikipedia : manual of style and wikipedia : layout for guidance ) while expert readers of such articles may accept complexity and length provided the article is well written , the general reader requires clarity and conciseness readable prose is the main body of the text , excluding material such as footnotes and reference sections ( '' see also '' , '' external links '' , bibliography , etc ) , diagrams and images , tables and lists , wikilinks and external urls , and formatting and mark-up it may be used for an article currently being looked at by selecting the view history tab for the page , then page statistics from the line near the top headed external tools total article size should be kept reasonably low , particularly for readers using slow internet connections or mobile devices or who have slow computer loading some large articles exist for topics that require depth and detail , but typically articles of such size are split into two or more smaller articles the maximum limit for wikipedia is set by the mediawiki software default article size limit , 2048 kibibytes ( specifically , 2,097,152 bytes ) in the independent article , put the or tag on the talk page to create a banner that refers back to the main article to conform with wp : c , which permit modification and reuse but require attribution of the content contributors , the new page should be created with an edit summary attesting proper copy attribution , such as '' split content from article name '' ) a note should also be made in the edit summary of the source article , '' split content to article name '' , to protect against the article subsequently being deleted and the history of the new page eradicated as browsers have improved , there is no need for haste in splitting an article when it starts getting large it also violates the neutral point of view policy to create a new article specifically to contain information that consensus has rejected from the main article markup size will always be greater than or equal to the readable prose size on which the above size guideline is based in most cases these are not reliable indications on their own of whether an article should be split often you can edit the article one section at a time by using the '' edit '' links you see next to each header in the article

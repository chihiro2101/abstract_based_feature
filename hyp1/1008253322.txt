each wikipedia article is in a process of evolution and is likely to continue growing an article longer than one or two pages when printed should be divided into sections to ease navigation ( see wikipedia : manual of style and wikipedia : layout for guidance ) readers of the mobile version of wikipedia can be helped by ensuring that sections are not so long or so numerous as to impede navigation at 10,000 words ( 50 & nbsp ; kb and above ) it may be beneficial to move some sections to other articles and replace them with summaries per wikipedia : summary style â€“ see a rule of thumb below while expert readers of such articles may accept complexity and length provided the article is well written , the general reader requires clarity and conciseness it may be used for an article currently being looked at by selecting the view history tab for the page , then page statistics from the line near the top headed external tools the prosesize gadget is also helpful for estimating readable prose size if there is no '' natural '' way to split or reduce a long list or table , it may be best to leave it intact , and a decision made to either keep it embedded in the main article or split it off into a stand-alone page total article size should be kept reasonably low , particularly for readers using slow internet connections or mobile devices or who have slow computer loading some large articles exist for topics that require depth and detail , but typically articles of such size are split into two or more smaller articles when you split a section from a long article into an independent article , you should leave a short summary of the material that is removed along with a pointer to the independent article to conform with wp : c , which permit modification and reuse but require attribution of the content contributors , the new page should be created with an edit summary attesting proper copy attribution , such as '' split content from article name '' ) a note should also be made in the edit summary of the source article , '' split content to article name '' , to protect against the article subsequently being deleted and the history of the new page eradicated a relatively trivial topic may be appropriate in the context of the larger article , but inappropriate as the topic of an entire article in itself also the search box entry : intitle : article title will show both number of words in the article and the size of the article in kilobytes many articles on wikipedia may be longer than 32 & nbsp ; kb on a permanent basis , so older browsers will continue to have occasional problems with long articles often you can edit the article one section at a time by using the '' edit '' links you see next to each header in the article

in questionnaire surveys , 35–50 % of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm for instance kratochvíl ( 1994 ) surveyed 200 women and found that 6 % reported ejaculating , an additional 13 % had some experience and about 60 % reported release of fluid without actual gushing reports on the volume of fluid expelled vary considerably , starting from amounts that would be imperceptible to a woman , to mean values of 1–5 ml the suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women 's health writer rebecca chalker as '' one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology '' female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical , medical , and biological literature throughout recorded history the reasons for the interest in female ejaculation have been questioned by feminist writers in the 17th century , the dutch anatomist reinier de graaf wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs concerning the generative organs of women which is much cited in the literature on this topic he identified xiii:212 the various controversies regarding the ejaculate and its origin , but stated he believed that this fluid '' which rushes out with such impetus during venereal combat or libidinous imagining '' was derived from a number of sources , including the vagina , urinary tract , cervix and uterus he appears to identify skene 's ducts , when he writes xiii : 213 '' those ducts which are visible around the orifice of the neck of the vagina and the outlet of the urinary passage receive their fluid from the female 'parastatae ' , or rather the thick membranous body around the urinary passage '' however he appears not to distinguish between the lubrication of the perineum during arousal and an orgasmic ejaculate when he refers to liquid '' which in libidinous women often rushes out at the mere sight of a handsome man '' however , his prime purpose was to distinguish between generative fluid and pleasurable fluid , in his stand on the aristotelian semen controversy krafft-ebing 's study of sexual perversion , psychopathia sexualis ( 1886 ) , describes female ejaculation under the heading '' congenital sexual inversion in women '' as a perversion related to neurasthenia and homosexuality ) stein and day , ny 1965 , at 265 it is also described by freud in pathological terms in his study of dora ( 1905 ) , where he relates it to hysteria ) the standard edition of the complete psychological works by sigmund freud , vol vii : 84 however , women 's writing of that time portrayed this in more positive terms anatomical knowledge was also advanced by alexander skene 's description of para-urethral or periurethral glands ( glands around the urethra ) in 1880 , which have been variously claimed to be one source of the fluids in the ejaculate , and now commonly referred to as the skene 's glands female ejaculation is mentioned as normal in early 20th century 'marriage manuals ' , such as th van de velde 's ideal marriage : its physiology and technique ( 1926 ) certainly van de velde was well aware of the varied experiences of women random , ny 1957 , pp 195–6 in 1948 , huffman , an american gynaecologist , published his studies of the prostatic tissue in women together with a historical account and detailed drawings these clearly showed the difference between the original glands identified by skene at the urinary meatus , and the more proximal collections of glandular tissue emptying directly into the urethra a more definitive contemporary account of ejaculation appeared shortly after , in 1950 , with the publication of an essay by gräfenberg based on his observations of women during orgasm & nbsp ;

the initial study on one woman by addiego and colleagues , reported in 1981 , could not be confirmed in a subsequent study on 11 women in 1983 , but was confirmed in another 7 women in 1984 the ejaculate was compared to pre-orgasmic urine from the same woman , and also to published data on male ejaculate the debate in the current literature focuses on three threads : the existence of female ejaculation , its source ( s ) and composition , and its relationship to theories of female sexuality josephine sevely then followed up her 1978 study by publishing '' eve 's secrets : a new theory of female sexuality '' in 1987 , emphasising an integrated rather than fragmented approach to understanding female sexuality , with the clitoris , vagina and urethra depicted as a single sexual organ tiefer has expressed concern that overemphasising ejaculation will drive women who might feel inadequate to seek medical attention ( see health implications below ) , as has the boston women 's health collective the presence of chemical markers such as psa or pap in the female genital tract has been considered evidence in rape trials , sensabaugh gf , kahane d easy on the eye productions considered it a '' historic victory '' although the bbfc maintains that its '' position remains fundamentally unchanged for future releases '' bartholin 's gland ejaculation kunyaza one sex two sex theory urethral sponge

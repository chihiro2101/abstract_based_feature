in questionnaire surveys , 35–50 % of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm for instance kratochvíl ( 1994 ) surveyed 200 women and found that 6 % reported ejaculating , an additional 13 % had some experience and about 60 % reported release of fluid without actual gushing reports on the volume of fluid expelled vary considerably , starting from amounts that would be imperceptible to a woman , to mean values of 1–5 ml the suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women 's health writer rebecca chalker as '' one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology '' female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical , medical , and biological literature throughout recorded history the reasons for the interest in female ejaculation have been questioned by feminist writers in the 16th century , the dutch physician laevinius lemnius , referred to how a woman '' draws forth the man 's seed and casts her own with it '' harvard , cambridge 1990 vii in the 17th century , françois mauriceau described glands at the female urethral meatus that '' pour out great quantities of saline liquor during coition , which increases the heat and enjoyment of women '' one sex two sex theory this century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function , in particular the work of the bartholin family in denmark in the 17th century , the dutch anatomist reinier de graaf wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs concerning the generative organs of women which is much cited in the literature on this topic de graaf discussed the original controversy but supported the aristotle view cited in chalker 2000 , p.121 he identified the source as the glandular structures and ducts surrounding the urethra he appears to identify skene 's ducts , when he writes xiii : 213 '' those ducts which are visible around the orifice of the neck of the vagina and the outlet of the urinary passage receive their fluid from the female 'parastatae ' , or rather the thick membranous body around the urinary passage '' further on xiii:214 he refers to '' liquid as usually comes from the pudenda in one gush '' however , his prime purpose was to distinguish between generative fluid and pleasurable fluid , in his stand on the aristotelian semen controversy krafft-ebing 's study of sexual perversion , psychopathia sexualis ( 1886 ) , describes female ejaculation under the heading '' congenital sexual inversion in women '' as a perversion related to neurasthenia and homosexuality ) stein and day , ny 1965 , at 265 it is also described by freud in pathological terms in his study of dora ( 1905 ) , where he relates it to hysteria these clearly showed the difference between the original glands identified by skene at the urinary meatus , and the more proximal collections of glandular tissue emptying directly into the urethra a more definitive contemporary account of ejaculation appeared shortly after , in 1950 , with the publication of an essay by gräfenberg based on his observations of women during orgasm however this paper made little impact , and was dismissed in the major sexological writings of that time , such as kinsey ( 1953 ) kinsey , a.c & nbsp ;

74–5 ) historically in rwanda , the kunyaza sexual technique has the reputation of triggering female ejaculation ( kunyara ) much of the problem in arriving at a consensus relates to a failure to adopt generally agreed-on definitions or research methodology research has used highly selected individuals , case studies , or very small numbers of subjects , making generalization difficult stated that '' many individuals refer to any fluid expressed from the vagina or urethra during coitus as female ejaculate , which leads to significant confusion in the literature further methodological issues include the fact that the composition of the fluid appears to vary with the menstrual cycle , and that the biochemical profile of the para-urethral tissues varies with age whether the fluid is secreted by the skene 's gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion ; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals , and are related to doubts over the existence of the g-spot , there is substantial evidence that the skene 's gland is the source of female ejaculation some research has distinguished between female ejaculation and what is colloquially known as squirting or gushing in these research publications , it is suggested that '' real '' female ejaculation is the release of a very scanty , thick , and whitish fluid from the female prostate , while the '' squirting '' or '' gushing '' ( shown frequently in pornography ) is a different phenomenon : the expulsion of clear and abundant fluid , which has been shown to be a diluted fluid from the urinary bladder in 1982 , bohlen explained the accepted wisdom : scientific studies from the 1980s and later have demonstrated that the substance produced is distinct from urine , though it does show similarities such as alkalinity with urine a recent study of women who report ejaculation found no evidence of any urological problems , suggesting these two conditions ( ejaculation and coital incontinence ) are quite distinct physiologically , although perhaps not always distinguishable in a particular individual 's mind it is also important for physicians to distinguish orgasmic ejaculation from vaginal discharges which may require further investigation and treatment the '' g-spot '' and '' female ejaculation '' : a current appraisal the book discussed female ejaculation and brought the issue back into discussions of women 's sexuality both in the medical community and among the general public the presence of chemical markers such as psa or pap in the female genital tract has been considered evidence in rape trials , sensabaugh gf , kahane d female ejaculation the double standard in the bedroom by eric jackson , 2008/09/22 the-clitoris.com : female ejaculation & the g-spot : instructions & diagrams from a feminist perspective

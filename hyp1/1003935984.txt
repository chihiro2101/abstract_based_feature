in questionnaire surveys , 35–50 % of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm other studies find anywhere from 10–69 % , depending on the definitions and methods used for instance kratochvíl ( 1994 ) surveyed 200 women and found that 6 % reported ejaculating , an additional 13 % had some experience and about 60 % reported release of fluid without actual gushing reports on the volume of fluid expelled vary considerably , starting from amounts that would be imperceptible to a woman , to mean values of 1–5 ml the suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women 's health writer rebecca chalker as '' one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology '' female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical , medical , and biological literature throughout recorded history the reasons for the interest in female ejaculation have been questioned by feminist writers in the 16th century , the dutch physician laevinius lemnius , referred to how a woman '' draws forth the man 's seed and casts her own with it '' one sex two sex theory this century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function , in particular the work of the bartholin family in denmark in the 17th century , the dutch anatomist reinier de graaf wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs concerning the generative organs of women which is much cited in the literature on this topic cited in chalker 2000 , p.121 he identified the source as the glandular structures and ducts surrounding the urethra he appears to identify skene 's ducts , when he writes xiii : 213 '' those ducts which are visible around the orifice of the neck of the vagina and the outlet of the urinary passage receive their fluid from the female 'parastatae ' , or rather the thick membranous body around the urinary passage '' however he appears not to distinguish between the lubrication of the perineum during arousal and an orgasmic ejaculate when he refers to liquid '' which in libidinous women often rushes out at the mere sight of a handsome man krafft-ebing 's study of sexual perversion , psychopathia sexualis ( 1886 ) , describes female ejaculation under the heading '' congenital sexual inversion in women '' as a perversion related to neurasthenia and homosexuality thus we find almeda sperry writing to emma goldman in 1918 , about the '' rhythmic spurt of your love juices '' female ejaculation is mentioned as normal in early 20th century 'marriage manuals ' , such as th van de velde 's ideal marriage : its physiology and technique ( 1926 ) certainly van de velde was well aware of the varied experiences of women van de velde , th random , ny 1957 , pp 195–6 in 1948 , huffman , an american gynaecologist , published his studies of the prostatic tissue in women together with a historical account and detailed drawings whipple became aware of the phenomenon when studying urinary incontinence , with which it is often confused as she observes , the female perineal urethra is embedded in the anterior vaginal wall and is surrounded by erectile tissue in all directions except posteriorly where it relates to the vaginal wall female ejaculation appears in 20th-century anthropology works , such as malinowski 's melanesian study , the sexual life of savages ( 1929 ) , and gladwin and sarason 's '' truk : man in paradise '' ( 1956 ) wenner-gren foundation for anthropological research , ny 1956 catherine blackledge ( p the ancient sexual practice has been exercised for over 150 years in east and central africa amongst the buganda tribe of uganda , the sexual practice is called kachabali ( spraying the wall ) much of the problem in arriving at a consensus relates to a failure to adopt generally agreed-on definitions or research methodology for instance , much of the research into the nature of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is or contains urine stated that '' many individuals refer to any fluid expressed from the vagina or urethra during coitus as female ejaculate , which leads to significant confusion in the literature '' there are also problems involved in the collection of specimens and issues of contamination since the area of interest is para-urethral glands , it is impossible to completely separate the secretions from urine , especially considering that there may be retrograde ejaculation into the urethra towards the bladder some research has distinguished between female ejaculation and what is colloquially known as squirting or gushing a recent study of women who report ejaculation found no evidence of any urological problems , suggesting these two conditions ( ejaculation and coital incontinence ) are quite distinct physiologically , although perhaps not always distinguishable in a particular individual 's mind one study by gary schubach used urethral catheterization in order to separate urine from orgasmic expulsions from elsewhere in the body it may be important for physicians to establish whether there is in fact any incontinence in women who report ejaculation , to avoid unnecessary interventions early work was contradictory ; the initial study on one woman by addiego and colleagues , reported in 1981 , could not be confirmed in a subsequent study on 11 women in 1983 , but was confirmed in another 7 women in 1984 the ejaculate was compared to pre-orgasmic urine from the same woman , and also to published data on male ejaculate pap and psa have been identified in the para-urethral tissues , using biochemical and immunohistochemical methods , suggesting that the ejaculate is likely to arise from the ducts in these tissues , in a manner homologous to that in the male bell 's critique lies at the heart of feminist concerns about this debate , namely a tendency to '' disregard , reinterpret , and overwrite women 's subjective descriptions advances another feminist theory : that because women 's pleasure in their sexuality has been historically excluded , the pleasure of ejaculation has been either discounted or appropriated by health professionals as a physiological phenomenon , female ejaculation and censorship in the uk the board later stated instead that it does not take any view on whether female ejaculation exists and explained that all

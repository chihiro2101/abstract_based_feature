in questionnaire surveys , 35–50 % of women report that they have at some time experienced the gushing of fluid during orgasm other studies find anywhere from 10–69 % , depending on the definitions and methods used for instance kratochvíl ( 1994 ) surveyed 200 women and found that 6 % reported ejaculating , an additional 13 % had some experience and about 60 % reported release of fluid without actual gushing the suggestion that women can expel fluid from their genital area as part of sexual arousal has been described by women 's health writer rebecca chalker as '' one of the most hotly debated questions in modern sexology '' female ejaculation has been discussed in anatomical , medical , and biological literature throughout recorded history the reasons for the interest in female ejaculation have been questioned by feminist writers harvard , cambridge 1990 vii in the 17th century , françois mauriceau described glands at the female urethral meatus that '' pour out great quantities of saline liquor during coition , which increases the heat and enjoyment of women '' one sex two sex theory this century saw an increasing understanding of female sexual anatomy and function , in particular the work of the bartholin family in denmark in the 17th century , the dutch anatomist reinier de graaf wrote an influential treatise on the reproductive organs concerning the generative organs of women which is much cited in the literature on this topic '' however he appears not to distinguish between the lubrication of the perineum during arousal and an orgasmic ejaculate when he refers to liquid '' which in libidinous women often rushes out at the mere sight of a handsome man '' however , his prime purpose was to distinguish between generative fluid and pleasurable fluid , in his stand on the aristotelian semen controversy ) the standard edition of the complete psychological works by sigmund freud , vol vii : 84 however , women 's writing of that time portrayed this in more positive terms female ejaculation is mentioned as normal in early 20th century 'marriage manuals ' , such as th van de velde 's ideal marriage : its physiology and technique ( 1926 ) random , ny 1957 , pp 195–6 in 1948 , huffman , an american gynaecologist , published his studies of the prostatic tissue in women together with a historical account and detailed drawings the detailed anatomy of the paraurethral ducts in the adult human female '' american journal of obstetrics and gynecology 55 : 86–101 , 1948 a more definitive contemporary account of ejaculation appeared shortly after , in 1950 , with the publication of an essay by gräfenberg based on his observations of women during orgasm sexual behavior in the human female & nbsp ;

74–5 ) historically in rwanda , the kunyaza sexual technique has the reputation of triggering female ejaculation ( kunyara ) much of the problem in arriving at a consensus relates to a failure to adopt generally agreed-on definitions or research methodology for instance , much of the research into the nature of the fluid focuses on determining whether it is or contains urine stated that '' many individuals refer to any fluid expressed from the vagina or urethra during coitus as female ejaculate , which leads to significant confusion in the literature whether the fluid is secreted by the skene 's gland through and around the urethra has also been a topic of discussion ; while the exact source and nature of the fluid remain controversial among medical professionals , and are related to doubts over the existence of the g-spot , there is substantial evidence that the skene 's gland is the source of female ejaculation some research has distinguished between female ejaculation and what is colloquially known as squirting or gushing in these research publications , it is suggested that '' real '' female ejaculation is the release of a very scanty , thick , and whitish fluid from the female prostate , while the '' squirting '' or '' gushing '' ( shown frequently in pornography ) is a different phenomenon : the expulsion of clear and abundant fluid , which has been shown to be a diluted fluid from the urinary bladder towards the later part of the 20th century , there was significant confusion between female ejaculation and coital incontinence one study by gary schubach used urethral catheterization in order to separate urine from orgasmic expulsions from elsewhere in the body in individual cases , the exact source of any reported discharge may not be obvious without further investigation research in this area has concentrated almost exclusively on attempts to prove that the ejaculate is not urine , measuring substances such as urea , creatinine , prostatic acid phosphatase ( pap ) , prostate-specific antigen ( psa ) , glucose and fructose levels the debate in the current literature focuses on three threads : the existence of female ejaculation , its source ( s ) and composition , and its relationship to theories of female sexuality for the reason that 'sameness ' has been construed as a male perspective , some feminists reject the term ejaculation many women , before learning about ejaculation , experienced shame or avoided sexual intimacy under the belief that they had wet the bed , female ejaculation and censorship in the uk the board later stated instead that it does not take any view on whether female ejaculation exists and explained that all apparent examples presented to the board were of simple urination masquerading as female ejaculation female ejaculation the double standard in the bedroom by eric jackson , 2008/09/22 the-clitoris.com : female ejaculation & the g-spot : instructions & diagrams from a feminist perspective

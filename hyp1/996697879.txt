rose first started working on what became the floyd rose tremolo in 1976 after noticing the strings moved freely with the regular nut design , he made a brass nut that locked the strings in place with three u-shaped clamps rose hand-made the first bridges and nuts , which were quickly picked up by some influential guitarists at the time , such as eddie van halen kramer 's guitar models with the floyd rose bridge became very popular , leading them to drop the earlier rockinger vibrato in favor of the floyd rose between june 1982 and january 1983 the floyd rose design 's popularity led to other companies making similar bridges , thus violating the patent floyd rose and kramer went on to make licensing agreements with other manufacturers , and there are now several different models available based on the double-locking design because the bridges and nuts were no longer hand-made it was necessary to update the design , and the bridges were changed to add a set of tuners that allow for fine-tuning the guitar after the strings are locked at the nut while fender used floyd rose-licensed vibrato systems previously , this move allowed fender to offer a few models with the original floyd rose tremolo , such as the richie sambora in 1991 , the floyd rose classic stratocaster in 1992 and the set-neck floyd rose strat in 1993 fender used the floyd rose-designed locking vibrato system on certain humbucker-equipped american deluxe and showmaster models until 2007 in 2005 , distribution of the floyd rose original reverted to floyd rose , whereas the patented designs were licensed to other manufacturers to use controlled by special tuning screws ( purple ) , these two forces are balanced such that the bridge 's surface is parallel to the guitar body ( olive ) position ii illustrates the position of the bridge when the vibrato arm is pushed down towards the guitar body note that the name '' floyd rose original '' is used to differentiate this system from '' floyd rose licensed '' later versions were made double locking , but used weaker materials than the original floyd rose , making them less dependable the bridge and arm design is changed in such a way that the guitarist 's hand is generally closer to the strings while holding the vibrato arm the floyd rose tremolo rose to popularity in the early 1980s floyd rose website floyd rose interview for namm oral history program

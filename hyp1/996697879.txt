rose first started working on what became the floyd rose tremolo in 1976 he frequently used the vibrato bar but could n't make his guitars stay in tune using traditional approaches like lubricating the nut , or winding the strings as little as possible around the tuning pegs rose hand-made the first bridges and nuts , which were quickly picked up by some influential guitarists at the time , such as eddie van halen kramer 's guitar models with the floyd rose bridge became very popular , leading them to drop the earlier rockinger vibrato in favor of the floyd rose between june 1982 and january 1983 the floyd rose design 's popularity led to other companies making similar bridges , thus violating the patent because the bridges and nuts were no longer hand-made it was necessary to update the design , and the bridges were changed to add a set of tuners that allow for fine-tuning the guitar after the strings are locked at the nut while fender used floyd rose-licensed vibrato systems previously , this move allowed fender to offer a few models with the original floyd rose tremolo , such as the richie sambora in 1991 , the floyd rose classic stratocaster in 1992 and the set-neck floyd rose strat in 1993 floyd rose collaborated with fender to design a fender deluxe locking tremolo , introduced in 1991 on the strat plus , the usa contemporary stratocaster , and the strat ultra fender used the floyd rose-designed locking vibrato system on certain humbucker-equipped american deluxe and showmaster models until 2007 in 2005 , distribution of the floyd rose original reverted to floyd rose , whereas the patented designs were licensed to other manufacturers to use position i illustrates the normal position of an ideally tuned floyd rose bridge controlled by special tuning screws ( purple ) , these two forces are balanced such that the bridge 's surface is parallel to the guitar body ( olive ) the bridge rotates around a pivot point counter-clockwise and the tension in each string decreases , lowering the pitch of each string the main advantage of the floyd rose vibrato system is its double-locking design note that the name '' floyd rose original '' is used to differentiate this system from '' floyd rose licensed '' floyd rose 1000 and floyd rose special are made with the same design as the original but manufactured in south korea the floyd rose tremolo rose to popularity in the early 1980s

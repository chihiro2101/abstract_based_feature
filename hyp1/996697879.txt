rose first started working on what became the floyd rose tremolo in 1976 after noticing the strings moved freely with the regular nut design , he made a brass nut that locked the strings in place with three u-shaped clamps later he improved this design by using hardened steel—otherwise the strings wore the clamps down too quickly—and redesigned the bridge , which also locked the strings with clamps kramer 's guitar models with the floyd rose bridge became very popular , leading them to drop the earlier rockinger vibrato in favor of the floyd rose between june 1982 and january 1983 notably , courts found that the kahler tremolo system infringed on floyd rose 's patents , and awarded a judgment in excess of 100m against gary kahler floyd rose and kramer went on to make licensing agreements with other manufacturers , and there are now several different models available based on the double-locking design while fender used floyd rose-licensed vibrato systems previously , this move allowed fender to offer a few models with the original floyd rose tremolo , such as the richie sambora in 1991 , the floyd rose classic stratocaster in 1992 and the set-neck floyd rose strat in 1993 floyd rose collaborated with fender to design a fender deluxe locking tremolo , introduced in 1991 on the strat plus , the usa contemporary stratocaster , and the strat ultra in 2005 , distribution of the floyd rose original reverted to floyd rose , whereas the patented designs were licensed to other manufacturers to use position i illustrates the normal position of an ideally tuned floyd rose bridge the strings are locked tightly with a special mechanism at the nut ( green ) as well as at the bridge ( turquoise ) , hence '' double-locking '' position ii illustrates the position of the bridge when the vibrato arm is pushed down towards the guitar body in this set-up , a broken string has no effect on the pitch of the other strings , as the reduced overall string tension from the broken string does n't make the bridge move , since it already presses against the body of the guitar note that the name '' floyd rose original '' is used to differentiate this system from '' floyd rose licensed '' floyd rose 1000 and floyd rose special are made with the same design as the original but manufactured in south korea vigier floyd rose created by vigier guitars at the beginning of the '90s , this system uses force-tolerant needle bearings for improved wear on the bridge and enhanced tuning stability the floyd rose tremolo rose to popularity in the early 1980s

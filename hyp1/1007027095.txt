following training and sea trials , thresher got underway from new london , connecticut on 25 october 1940 for engineering trials in gravesend bay , new york , and shakedown off the dry tortugas she set sail on 1 may 1941 for the caribbean sea , en route for pearl harbor , transiting the panama canal on 9 may , stopping in san diego , through 21 may , and arriving at pearl harbor on 31 may thresher and her sister-ship departed the submarine base pearl harbor on 31 october 1941 on a simulated war patrol north of midway island ; both carried live torpedoes tautog returned first ; and , on 7 december , thresher neared the hawaiian islands to end her cruise escorted by the destroyer through hawaiian waters lest she be mistaken for a hostile submarine , thresher received word at 08:10 pearl harbor was under attack by japanese aircraft litchfield promptly set off to join american light forces departing from the harbor , leaving thresher alone to conduct her first real war patrol however , the destroyer was ordered back to escort ; radio contact was established , and a rendezvous arranged , with thresher at the pre-appointed time , thresher poked up her periscope to have a look , and noticed a destroyer—similar to litchfield—approaching bows-on departing pearl harbor on 30 december 1941 , thresher headed for the marshall and mariana islands a little before daybreak , a small freighter was sighted north of agana harbor and thresher closed for the attack there , she was to gather weather data off honshū for use by admiral william halsey 's task force ( the carriers and , then approaching japan warned by ultra of four japanese submarines operating off tokyo bay , thresher was detected by one of them and fired on , without damage when the target emerged from the murk , thresher was not in a position to launch another attack and proceeded on her way on 13 april , running on the surface to recharge her batteries , thresher took a wave over her conning tower she was detached from this duty on 16 april and , after evading two japanese patrol planes , returned to pearl harbor on 29 april the two surface escorts were soon joined by aircraft and , after a three-hour depth charging , thresher was able to resume her search for other targets three days later , midway between kwajalein and wotje atolls , thresher fired two torpedoes at a 4,836 & nbsp ; ton torpedo boat tender which caused tremendous explosions as the tender sank beneath the waves thresher withdrew from expected countermeasures then , as a depth charge exploded near her conning tower , the boat went deeper bending on rudder , thresher left the enemy behind , with some 30-odd depth charges exploding in her wake shaken but not seriously damaged , thresher made minor repairs as she headed for truk to reconnoiter the passes leading into this enemy naval bastion the boat 's sonar picked up the sound of screws , close and closing soon an enemy patrol craft came into view , on a collision course thresher went deep , while the enemy 's guns fired close but ineffective salvoes into the water ahead of the disappearing boat after escaping to the palaus , thresher tangled with an enemy q-ship off ambon in the former netherlands east indies the two torpedoes she fired at the enemy failed to explode , a persistent problem for the mark 14 torpedo 's mark 6 exploder since she had been reassigned to the southwest pacific submarine force , thresher sailed away from this encounter en route to australian waters and terminated her fourth war patrol at fremantle on 15 august after refit , thresher loaded mines and departed fremantle on 15 september 1942 , bound for the gulf of siam she fired torpedoes at two freighters north of lombok strait on 19 september but was unable to determine the results of her attacks on the night of 25 september , luck again failed to smile on her as a single torpedo streaked beneath a large , high-speed target in the sulu sea thresher later surfaced at 23:00 and proceeded on a course which took her north to pearl bank these strategic mine fields laid by thresher and her sisters in subsequent patrols , covered japanese shipping lanes in areas of the southwest pacific command previously unpatrolled by submarines she intercepted a convoy of freighters , escorted by two destroyers , several subchasers , and two aircraft slipping past the escorts , thresher sent five torpedoes towards the leading three ships rising to periscope depth , the boat observed the second ship in the column down by the bow , with her stern up in the air and her screws , still revolving , out of the water after arriving back in fremantle on 10 january 1943 , the boat got underway 15 days later for her seventh war patrol , with four torpedoes short of a normal load at 11:00 on 14 february , thresher made contact with a japanese i-65 class submarine east of thwartway island she launched two torpedoes ; one was a dud , and the other exploded on the ocean bottom proceeding to the flores sea , thresher intercepted a three-ship convoy escorted by two anti-submarine vessels on 21 february thresher then evaded 13 depth charges before returning to periscope depth a little more than an hour later as escorts searched the waters nearby , thresher closed and torpedoed the second transport , which had stopped to transfer survivors her eighth war patrol ( commanded by harry hull , class of 1932 ) , lasting 4 april to 23 may 1943 , was uneventful , but her ninth saw the boat score another kill chasing her quarry along the sulawesi ( celebes ) coast , the submarine lurked nearby until the escort left thresher then closed , loosed three torpedoes , and scored one hit on the bow of the enemy vessel this blow failed to stop the tanker , which fired her guns to keep thresher at bay as she escaped at high speed four days later , thresher arrived off catmou point , negros island prowling north of truk , thresher commenced tracking a five-ship convoy on the morning of 12 november and slipped past two escorts shortly before midnight escorting antisubmarine craft hunted in vain for the american attacker , dropping 20 depth charges in a harassing barrage coming to periscope depth soon thereafter , she approached cautiously , keeping in mind the ship may have been the advance screen of a convoy at 11:43 on 15 january , she came to the surface and spotted a japanese aircraft carrier with an escorting destroyer soon thereafter thresher deployed to a position astern of the convoy , to trail the enemy group and be ready to pick off stragglers four explosions were sighted and as thresher departed at high speed , another six soon after after fueling at midway on 8 october , thresher sailed for the hawaiian islands and arrived at pearl harbor on 12 october 1944 thresher received 15 battle stars and a navy unit commendation for world war ii service , making her the most decorated submarine and amongst the most decorated us ships of world war ii

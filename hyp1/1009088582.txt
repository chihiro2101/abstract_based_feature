hydrogen sulfide is slightly denser than air ; a mixture of and air can be explosive hydrogen sulfide burns in oxygen with a blue flame to form sulfur dioxide and water in general , hydrogen sulfide acts as a reducing agent , especially in the presence of base , which forms sh − at high temperatures or in the presence of catalysts , sulfur dioxide reacts with hydrogen sulfide to form elemental sulfur and water this reaction is exploited in the claus process , an important industrial method to dispose of hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide is slightly soluble in water and acts as a weak acid ( pk a & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 6.9 in 0.01–0.1 & nbsp ; mol/litre solutions at 18 & nbsp ; °c ) , giving the hydrosulfide ion ( also written hydrogen sulfide and its solutions are colorless when exposed to air , it slowly oxidizes to form elemental sulfur , which is not soluble in water hydrogen sulfide reacts with metal ions to form metal sulfides , which are insoluble , often dark colored solids lead ( ii ) acetate paper is used to detect hydrogen sulfide because it readily converts to lead ( ii ) sulfide , which is black treating metal sulfides with strong acid often liberates hydrogen sulfide at pressures above 90 & nbsp ; gpa ( gigapascal ) , hydrogen sulfide becomes a metallic conductor of electricity it can also be produced by treating hydrogen with molten elemental sulfur at about 450 & nbsp ; °c elemental sulfur ) to redox organic compounds or hydrogen ; this produces hydrogen sulfide as a waste product water heaters can aid the conversion of sulfate in water to hydrogen sulfide gas three enzymes are known to synthesize : cystathionine γ-lyase ( cse ) , cystathionine β-synthetase ( cbs ) and 3-mercaptopyruvate sulfurtransferase ( 3-mst ) these enzymes have been identified in a breadth of biological cells and tissues , and their activity has been observed to be induced by a number of disease states dietary amino acids , such as methionine and cysteine serve as the primary substrates for the transulfuration pathways and in the production of hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide can also be synthesized by non-enzymatic pathway , which is derived from proteins such as ferredoxins and rieske proteins the main use of hydrogen sulfide is as a precursor to elemental sulfur for well over a century hydrogen sulfide was important in analytical chemistry in the qualitative inorganic analysis of metal ions as indicated above , many metal ions react with hydrogen sulfide to give the corresponding metal sulfides metal parts are sometimes passivated with hydrogen sulfide catalysts used in hydrodesulfurization are routinely activated with hydrogen sulfide , and the behavior of metallic catalysts used in other parts of a refining is also modified using hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide is used to separate deuterium oxide , or heavy water , from normal water via the girdler sulfide process scientists from the university of exeter discovered that cell exposure to small amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas can prevent mitochondrial damage image : deposit from hydrogen sulphide.jpg thumb deposit of sulfur on a rock , caused by volcanic gas small amounts of hydrogen sulfide occur in crude petroleum , but natural gas can contain up to 30 % hydrogen sulfide can be present naturally in well water , often as a result of the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria by far the largest industrial source of is oil refinery : the hydrodesulfurization process liberates sulfur from petroleum by the action of hydrogen the resulting is converted to elemental sulfur by partial combustion via the claus process , which is a major source of elemental sulfur if there is a source of sulfate bearing material , such as plasterboard or natural gypsum ( calcium sulphate dihydrate ) , under anaerobic conditions sulfate reducing bacteria converts this to hydrogen sulfide sulfates are relatively non-inhibitory to methanobacteria but can be reduced to h 2 s by sulfate reducing bacteria , of which there are several genera a number of processes have been designed to remove hydrogen sulfide from drinking water oxygen is added to water and a reaction between oxygen and hydrogen sulfide react to produce odorless sulfate hydrogen sulfide generated in this process is typically converted to elemental sulfur using the claus process these effects are believed to be due to the fact that hydrogen sulfide combines with alkali present in moist surface tissues to form sodium sulfide , a caustic a monroe county sheriff officer initially determined that the space contained hydrogen sulfide and methane gas produced by decomposing vegetation several groups of bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide as fuel , oxidizing it to elemental sulfur or to sulfate by using dissolved oxygen , metal oxides ( e.g in particular , a buildup of hydrogen sulfide in the atmosphere may have caused , or at least contributed to , the permian-triassic extinction event 252 million years ago

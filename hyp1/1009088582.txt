hydrogen sulfide is slightly denser than air ; a mixture of and air can be explosive hydrogen sulfide burns in oxygen with a blue flame to form sulfur dioxide and water in general , hydrogen sulfide acts as a reducing agent , especially in the presence of base , which forms sh − at high temperatures or in the presence of catalysts , sulfur dioxide reacts with hydrogen sulfide to form elemental sulfur and water this reaction is exploited in the claus process , an important industrial method to dispose of hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide and its solutions are colorless the sulfide anion is not formed in aqueous solution lead ( ii ) acetate paper is used to detect hydrogen sulfide because it readily converts to lead ( ii ) sulfide , which is black treating metal sulfides with strong acid often liberates hydrogen sulfide if hydrogen sulfide is pressurized at higher temperatures , then cooled , the critical temperature reaches , the highest accepted superconducting critical temperature as of 2015 hydrogen sulfide is most commonly obtained by its separation from sour gas , which is natural gas with a high content of it can also be produced by treating hydrogen with molten elemental sulfur at about 450 & nbsp ; °c elemental sulfur ) to redox organic compounds or hydrogen ; this produces hydrogen sulfide as a waste product water heaters can aid the conversion of sulfate in water to hydrogen sulfide gas 3-mst also contributes to hydrogen sulfide production by way of the cysteine catabolic pathway dietary amino acids , such as methionine and cysteine serve as the primary substrates for the transulfuration pathways and in the production of hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide signaling is also innately intertwined with physiological processes that are known to be moderated by reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and reactive nitrogen species ( rns ) hydrogen sulfide is also known to increase the levels of glutathione which acts to reduce or disrupt ros levels in cells production of sulfur , thioorganic compounds , and alkali metal sulfides specifically , salts of sh − break bonds between lignin and cellulose components of pulp in the kraft process reversibly sodium sulfide in the presence of acids turns into hydrosulfides and hydrogen sulfide ; this supplies hydrosulfides in organic solutions and is utilized in the production of thiophenol as indicated above , many metal ions react with hydrogen sulfide to give the corresponding metal sulfides for example , gases or waters contaminated by hydrogen sulfide can be cleaned with metals , by forming metal sulfides in the purification of metal ores by flotation , mineral powders are often treated with hydrogen sulfide to enhance the separation catalysts used in hydrodesulfurization are routinely activated with hydrogen sulfide , and the behavior of metallic catalysts used in other parts of a refining is also modified using hydrogen sulfide scientists from the university of exeter discovered that cell exposure to small amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas can prevent mitochondrial damage when the cell is stressed with disease , enzymes are drawn into the cell to produce small amounts of hydrogen sulfide image : deposit from hydrogen sulphide.jpg thumb deposit of sulfur on a rock , caused by volcanic gas small amounts of hydrogen sulfide occur in crude petroleum , but natural gas can contain up to 30 % hydrogen sulfide is created by the human body in small doses through bacterial breakdown of proteins containing sulfur in the intestinal tract , therefore it contributes to the characteristic odor of flatulence other anthropogenic sources of hydrogen sulfide include coke ovens , paper mills ( using the kraft process ) , tanneries and sewerage arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes in contact with organic material , especially at high temperatures in industrial anaerobic digestion processes , such as wastewater treatment or the anaerobic digestion , hydrogen sulfide can be formed from the reduction of sulfate and the degradation of amino acids and proteins within organic compounds ; continuous chlorination : for levels up to 75 & nbsp ; mg/l chlorine is used in the purification process as an oxidizing chemical to react with hydrogen sulfide ; aeration : for concentrations of hydrogen sulfide less than 2 & nbsp ; mg/l aeration is an ideal treatment process ; nitrate addition : calcium nitrate can be used to prevent hydrogen sulfide formation in wastewater streams in such processes , the hydrogen sulfide is first converted to an ammonium salt , whereas the natural gas is unaffected hydrogen sulfide was used by the british army as a chemical weapon during world war i other bacteria liberate hydrogen sulfide from sulfur-containing amino acids ; this gives rise to the odor of rotten eggs and contributes to the odor of flatulence the biochemistry of hydrogen sulfide is a key part of the chemistry of the iron-sulfur world

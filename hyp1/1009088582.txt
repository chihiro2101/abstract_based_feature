hydrogen sulfide is slightly denser than air ; a mixture of and air can be explosive hydrogen sulfide burns in oxygen with a blue flame to form sulfur dioxide and water in general , hydrogen sulfide acts as a reducing agent , especially in the presence of base , which forms sh − at high temperatures or in the presence of catalysts , sulfur dioxide reacts with hydrogen sulfide to form elemental sulfur and water this reaction is exploited in the claus process , an important industrial method to dispose of hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide is slightly soluble in water and acts as a weak acid ( pk a & nbsp ; & nbsp ; 6.9 in 0.01–0.1 & nbsp ; mol/litre solutions at 18 & nbsp ; °c ) , giving the hydrosulfide ion ( also written hydrogen sulfide and its solutions are colorless when exposed to air , it slowly oxidizes to form elemental sulfur , which is not soluble in water hydrogen sulfide reacts with metal ions to form metal sulfides , which are insoluble , often dark colored solids treating metal sulfides with strong acid often liberates hydrogen sulfide the critical temperature increases with pressure , ranging from 23 & nbsp ; k at 100 & nbsp ; gpa to 150 & nbsp ; k at 200 & nbsp ; gpa by substituting a small part of sulfur with phosphorus and using even higher pressures , it has been predicted that it may be possible to raise the critical temperature to above and achieve room-temperature superconductor hydrogen sulfide is most commonly obtained by its separation from sour gas , which is natural gas with a high content of it can also be produced by treating hydrogen with molten elemental sulfur at about 450 & nbsp ; °c elemental sulfur ) to redox organic compounds or hydrogen ; this produces hydrogen sulfide as a waste product water heaters can aid the conversion of sulfate in water to hydrogen sulfide gas this is due to providing a warm environment sustainable for sulfur bacteria and maintaining the reaction which interacts between sulfate in the water and the water heater anode , which is usually made from magnesium metal hydrogen sulfide can be generated in cells via enzymatic or non enzymatic pathway 3-mst also contributes to hydrogen sulfide production by way of the cysteine catabolic pathway hydrogen sulfide can also be synthesized by non-enzymatic pathway , which is derived from proteins such as ferredoxins and rieske proteins the field of h 2 s biology has advanced from environmental toxicology to investigate the roles of endogenously produced h 2 s in physiological conditions and in various pathophysiological states the main use of hydrogen sulfide is as a precursor to elemental sulfur several organosulfur compounds are produced using hydrogen sulfide reversibly sodium sulfide in the presence of acids turns into hydrosulfides and hydrogen sulfide ; this supplies hydrosulfides in organic solutions and is utilized in the production of thiophenol in the purification of metal ores by flotation , mineral powders are often treated with hydrogen sulfide to enhance the separation metal parts are sometimes passivated with hydrogen sulfide scientists from the university of exeter discovered that cell exposure to small amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas can prevent mitochondrial damage when the cell is stressed with disease , enzymes are drawn into the cell to produce small amounts of hydrogen sulfide a suspended animation-like state has been induced in rodents with the use of hydrogen sulfide , resulting in hypothermia with a concomitant reduction in metabolic rate volcanoes and some hot springs ( as well as cold springs ) emit some , where it probably arises via the hydrolysis of sulfide minerals , i.e hydrogen sulfide can be present naturally in well water , often as a result of the action of sulfate-reducing bacteria hydrogen sulfide is created by the human body in small doses through bacterial breakdown of proteins containing sulfur in the intestinal tract , therefore it contributes to the characteristic odor of flatulence if there is a source of sulfate bearing material , such as plasterboard or natural gypsum ( calcium sulphate dihydrate ) , under anaerobic conditions sulfate reducing bacteria converts this to hydrogen sulfide in industrial anaerobic digestion processes , such as wastewater treatment or the anaerobic digestion , hydrogen sulfide can be formed from the reduction of sulfate and the degradation of amino acids and proteins within organic compounds : rnh 2 + h 2 s rnh + sh − the bisulfide anion is subsequently regenerated by heating of the amine sulfide solution these effects are believed to be due to the fact that hydrogen sulfide combines with alkali present in moist surface tissues to form sodium sulfide , a caustic in the absence of oxygen , sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from redox hydrogen or organic molecules by reducing elemental sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide several groups of bacteria can use hydrogen sulfide as fuel , oxidizing it to elemental sulfur or to sulfate by using dissolved oxygen , metal oxides ( e.g in this model of the origin of life on earth , geologically produced hydrogen sulfide is postulated as an electron donor driving the reduction of carbon dioxide

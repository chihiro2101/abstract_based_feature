hydrogen sulfide burns in oxygen with a blue flame to form sulfur dioxide and water in general , hydrogen sulfide acts as a reducing agent , especially in the presence of base , which forms sh − at high temperatures or in the presence of catalysts , sulfur dioxide reacts with hydrogen sulfide to form elemental sulfur and water this reaction is exploited in the claus process , an important industrial method to dispose of hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide and its solutions are colorless hydrogen sulfide reacts with metal ions to form metal sulfides , which are insoluble , often dark colored solids treating metal sulfides with strong acid often liberates hydrogen sulfide at pressures above 90 & nbsp ; gpa ( gigapascal ) , hydrogen sulfide becomes a metallic conductor of electricity the critical temperature increases with pressure , ranging from 23 & nbsp ; k at 100 & nbsp ; gpa to 150 & nbsp ; k at 200 & nbsp ; gpa by substituting a small part of sulfur with phosphorus and using even higher pressures , it has been predicted that it may be possible to raise the critical temperature to above and achieve room-temperature superconductor hydrogen sulfide is most commonly obtained by its separation from sour gas , which is natural gas with a high content of it can also be produced by treating hydrogen with molten elemental sulfur at about 450 & nbsp ; °c sulfur-reducing ) bacteria generate usable energy under low-oxygen conditions by using sulfates ( resp elemental sulfur ) to redox organic compounds or hydrogen ; this produces hydrogen sulfide as a waste product water heaters can aid the conversion of sulfate in water to hydrogen sulfide gas hydrogen sulfide can be generated in cells via enzymatic or non enzymatic pathway it is becoming increasingly clear that is an important mediator of a wide range of cell functions in health and in disease these enzymes are characterized by the transfer of a sulfur atom from methionine to serine to form a cysteine molecule has been shown to be involved in physiological processes like vasodilatation in animals , increasing seed germination and stress responses in plants hydrogen sulfide signaling is also innately intertwined with physiological processes that are known to be moderated by reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and reactive nitrogen species ( rns ) hydrogen sulfide is also known to increase the levels of glutathione which acts to reduce or disrupt ros levels in cells although the understanding of h 2 s biology has significantly advanced over the last decade , many questions remain , for instance related to the quantification of endogenous h 2 s levels the main use of hydrogen sulfide is as a precursor to elemental sulfur several organosulfur compounds are produced using hydrogen sulfide specifically , salts of sh − break bonds between lignin and cellulose components of pulp in the kraft process for well over a century hydrogen sulfide was important in analytical chemistry in the qualitative inorganic analysis of metal ions as indicated above , many metal ions react with hydrogen sulfide to give the corresponding metal sulfides catalysts used in hydrodesulfurization are routinely activated with hydrogen sulfide , and the behavior of metallic catalysts used in other parts of a refining is also modified using hydrogen sulfide scientists from the university of exeter discovered that cell exposure to small amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas can prevent mitochondrial damage this study could have further implications on preventing strokes , heart disease and arthritis a suspended animation-like state has been induced in rodents with the use of hydrogen sulfide , resulting in hypothermia with a concomitant reduction in metabolic rate the resulting is converted to elemental sulfur by partial combustion via the claus process , which is a major source of elemental sulfur other anthropogenic sources of hydrogen sulfide include coke ovens , paper mills ( using the kraft process ) , tanneries and sewerage arises from virtually anywhere where elemental sulfur comes in contact with organic material , especially at high temperatures depending on environmental conditions , it is responsible for deterioration of material through the action of some sulfur oxidizing microorganisms in the absence of oxygen , sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from redox hydrogen or organic molecules by reducing elemental sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide some of the hydrogen sulfide will react with metal ions in the water to produce metal sulfides , which are not water-soluble the biochemistry of hydrogen sulfide is a key part of the chemistry of the iron-sulfur world hydrogen sulfide is lethal to most animals , but a few highly specialized species ( extremophiles ) do thrive in habitats that are rich in this compound

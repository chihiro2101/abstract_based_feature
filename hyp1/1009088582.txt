hydrogen sulfide is slightly denser than air ; a mixture of and air can be explosive hydrogen sulfide burns in oxygen with a blue flame to form sulfur dioxide and water in general , hydrogen sulfide acts as a reducing agent , especially in the presence of base , which forms sh − at high temperatures or in the presence of catalysts , sulfur dioxide reacts with hydrogen sulfide to form elemental sulfur and water this reaction is exploited in the claus process , an important industrial method to dispose of hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide and its solutions are colorless when exposed to air , it slowly oxidizes to form elemental sulfur , which is not soluble in water hydrogen sulfide reacts with metal ions to form metal sulfides , which are insoluble , often dark colored solids lead ( ii ) acetate paper is used to detect hydrogen sulfide because it readily converts to lead ( ii ) sulfide , which is black treating metal sulfides with strong acid often liberates hydrogen sulfide the critical temperature increases with pressure , ranging from 23 & nbsp ; k at 100 & nbsp ; gpa to 150 & nbsp ; k at 200 & nbsp ; gpa if hydrogen sulfide is pressurized at higher temperatures , then cooled , the critical temperature reaches , the highest accepted superconducting critical temperature as of 2015 hydrogen sulfide is most commonly obtained by its separation from sour gas , which is natural gas with a high content of elemental sulfur ) to redox organic compounds or hydrogen ; this produces hydrogen sulfide as a waste product water heaters can aid the conversion of sulfate in water to hydrogen sulfide gas this is due to providing a warm environment sustainable for sulfur bacteria and maintaining the reaction which interacts between sulfate in the water and the water heater anode , which is usually made from magnesium metal these enzymes are characterized by the transfer of a sulfur atom from methionine to serine to form a cysteine molecule 3-mst also contributes to hydrogen sulfide production by way of the cysteine catabolic pathway dietary amino acids , such as methionine and cysteine serve as the primary substrates for the transulfuration pathways and in the production of hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide signaling is also innately intertwined with physiological processes that are known to be moderated by reactive oxygen species ( ros ) and reactive nitrogen species ( rns ) the main use of hydrogen sulfide is as a precursor to elemental sulfur these include methanethiol , ethanethiol , and thioglycolic acid for well over a century hydrogen sulfide was important in analytical chemistry in the qualitative inorganic analysis of metal ions for example , gases or waters contaminated by hydrogen sulfide can be cleaned with metals , by forming metal sulfides catalysts used in hydrodesulfurization are routinely activated with hydrogen sulfide , and the behavior of metallic catalysts used in other parts of a refining is also modified using hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide is used to separate deuterium oxide , or heavy water , from normal water via the girdler sulfide process in addition , hydrogen sulfide has been shown to reduce inflammation in various situations image : deposit from hydrogen sulphide.jpg thumb deposit of sulfur on a rock , caused by volcanic gas small amounts of hydrogen sulfide occur in crude petroleum , but natural gas can contain up to 30 % the resulting is converted to elemental sulfur by partial combustion via the claus process , which is a major source of elemental sulfur a number of processes have been designed to remove hydrogen sulfide from drinking water ; aeration : for concentrations of hydrogen sulfide less than 2 & nbsp ; mg/l aeration is an ideal treatment process ; nitrate addition : calcium nitrate can be used to prevent hydrogen sulfide formation in wastewater streams : rnh 2 + h 2 s rnh + sh − the bisulfide anion is subsequently regenerated by heating of the amine sulfide solution hydrogen sulfide generated in this process is typically converted to elemental sulfur using the claus process hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas ( flammable range : 4.3–46 % ) usepa ; health and environmental effects profile for hydrogen sulfide p.118-8 ( 1980 ) ecao-cin-026a 320–530 & nbsp ; ppm leads to pulmonary edema with the possibility of death in the absence of oxygen , sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from redox hydrogen or organic molecules by reducing elemental sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide the biochemistry of hydrogen sulfide is a key part of the chemistry of the iron-sulfur world hydrogen sulfide has often been detected in the interstellar medium

hydrogen sulfide is slightly denser than air ; a mixture of and air can be explosive hydrogen sulfide burns in oxygen with a blue flame to form sulfur dioxide and water in general , hydrogen sulfide acts as a reducing agent , especially in the presence of base , which forms sh − at high temperatures or in the presence of catalysts , sulfur dioxide reacts with hydrogen sulfide to form elemental sulfur and water this reaction is exploited in the claus process , an important industrial method to dispose of hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide and its solutions are colorless when exposed to air , it slowly oxidizes to form elemental sulfur , which is not soluble in water hydrogen sulfide reacts with metal ions to form metal sulfides , which are insoluble , often dark colored solids lead ( ii ) acetate paper is used to detect hydrogen sulfide because it readily converts to lead ( ii ) sulfide , which is black treating metal sulfides with strong acid often liberates hydrogen sulfide at pressures above 90 & nbsp ; gpa ( gigapascal ) , hydrogen sulfide becomes a metallic conductor of electricity if hydrogen sulfide is pressurized at higher temperatures , then cooled , the critical temperature reaches , the highest accepted superconducting critical temperature as of 2015 hydrogen sulfide is most commonly obtained by its separation from sour gas , which is natural gas with a high content of it can also be produced by treating hydrogen with molten elemental sulfur at about 450 & nbsp ; °c hydrocarbons can serve as a source of hydrogen in this process elemental sulfur ) to redox organic compounds or hydrogen ; this produces hydrogen sulfide as a waste product water heaters can aid the conversion of sulfate in water to hydrogen sulfide gas these enzymes have been identified in a breadth of biological cells and tissues , and their activity has been observed to be induced by a number of disease states these enzymes are characterized by the transfer of a sulfur atom from methionine to serine to form a cysteine molecule the main use of hydrogen sulfide is as a precursor to elemental sulfur several organosulfur compounds are produced using hydrogen sulfide specifically , salts of sh − break bonds between lignin and cellulose components of pulp in the kraft process for well over a century hydrogen sulfide was important in analytical chemistry in the qualitative inorganic analysis of metal ions as indicated above , many metal ions react with hydrogen sulfide to give the corresponding metal sulfides in the purification of metal ores by flotation , mineral powders are often treated with hydrogen sulfide to enhance the separation metal parts are sometimes passivated with hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide is used to separate deuterium oxide , or heavy water , from normal water via the girdler sulfide process scientists from the university of exeter discovered that cell exposure to small amounts of hydrogen sulfide gas can prevent mitochondrial damage when the cell is stressed with disease , enzymes are drawn into the cell to produce small amounts of hydrogen sulfide a suspended animation-like state has been induced in rodents with the use of hydrogen sulfide , resulting in hypothermia with a concomitant reduction in metabolic rate image : deposit from hydrogen sulphide.jpg thumb deposit of sulfur on a rock , caused by volcanic gas small amounts of hydrogen sulfide occur in crude petroleum , but natural gas can contain up to 30 % volcanoes and some hot springs ( as well as cold springs ) emit some , where it probably arises via the hydrolysis of sulfide minerals , i.e the resulting is converted to elemental sulfur by partial combustion via the claus process , which is a major source of elemental sulfur ; continuous chlorination : for levels up to 75 & nbsp ; mg/l chlorine is used in the purification process as an oxidizing chemical to react with hydrogen sulfide hydrogen sulfide generated in this process is typically converted to elemental sulfur using the claus process hydrogen sulfide is a highly toxic and flammable gas ( flammable range : 4.3–46 % ) if death does not occur , high exposure to hydrogen sulfide can lead to cortical pseudolaminar necrosis , degeneration of the basal ganglia and cerebral edema hydrogen sulfide was used by the british army as a chemical weapon during world war i in the absence of oxygen , sulfur-reducing and sulfate-reducing bacteria derive energy from redox hydrogen or organic molecules by reducing elemental sulfur or sulfate to hydrogen sulfide

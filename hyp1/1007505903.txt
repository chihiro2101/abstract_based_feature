sharpe ( 1964 ) , john lintner ( 1965a , b ) and jan mossin ( 1966 ) independently , building on the earlier work of harry markowitz on diversification and modern portfolio theory fischer black ( 1972 ) developed another version of capm , called black capm or zero-beta capm , that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset the capm returns the asset-appropriate required return or discount rate—i.e given the accepted concave utility function , the capm is consistent with intuition—investors ( should ) require a higher return for holding a more risky asset stock market indices are frequently used as local proxies for the market—and in that case ( by definition ) have a beta of one an investor in a large , diversified portfolio ( such as a mutual fund ) , therefore , expects performance in line with the market the risk of a portfolio comprises systematic risk , also known as undiversifiable risk , and specific risk which is also known as idiosyncratic risk or diversifiable risk systematic risk refers to the risk common to all securities—i.e depending on the market , a portfolio of approximately 30–40 securities in developed markets such as the uk or us will render the portfolio sufficiently diversified such that risk exposure is limited to systematic risk only in developing markets a larger number is required , due to the higher asset volatilities a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk , as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model therefore , the required return on an asset , that is , the return that compensates for risk taken , must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i.e in the capm context , portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i.e because the unsystematic risk is diversifiable , the total risk of a portfolio can be viewed as beta the traditional capm using historical data as the inputs to solve for a future return of asset i a critique of the traditional capm is that the risk measure used remains constant ( non-varying beta ) the model assumes that the variance of returns is an adequate measurement of risk barclays wealth have published some research on asset allocation with non-normal returns which shows that investors with very low risk tolerances should hold more cash than capm suggests the model assumes that all active and potential shareholders have access to the same information and agree about the risk and expected return of all assets ( homogeneous expectations assumption ) arbitrage pricing theory carhart four-factor model consumption beta ( ccapm ) fama–french three-factor model intertemporal capm ( icapm ) build-up method chance-constrained portfolio selection the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) , short-sale restrictions and related issues , journal of finance , 32 ( 177 ) stone , bernell k

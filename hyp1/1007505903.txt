sharpe ( 1964 ) , john lintner ( 1965a , b ) and jan mossin ( 1966 ) independently , building on the earlier work of harry markowitz on diversification and modern portfolio theory fischer black ( 1972 ) developed another version of capm , called black capm or zero-beta capm , that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset the capm returns the asset-appropriate required return or discount rate—i.e the rate at which future cash flows produced by the asset should be discounted given that asset 's relative riskiness given the accepted concave utility function , the capm is consistent with intuition—investors ( should ) require a higher return for holding a more risky asset market risk , the market as a whole , by definition , has a beta of one stock market indices are frequently used as local proxies for the market—and in that case ( by definition ) have a beta of one the risk of a portfolio comprises systematic risk , also known as undiversifiable risk , and specific risk which is also known as idiosyncratic risk or diversifiable risk unsystematic risk is the risk associated with individual assets unsystematic risk can be diversified away to smaller levels by including a greater number of assets in the portfolio ( specific risks '' average out '' ) depending on the market , a portfolio of approximately 30–40 securities in developed markets such as the uk or us will render the portfolio sufficiently diversified such that risk exposure is limited to systematic risk only in developing markets a larger number is required , due to the higher asset volatilities therefore , the required return on an asset , that is , the return that compensates for risk taken , must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i.e the capm assumes that the risk-return profile of a portfolio can be optimized—an optimal portfolio displays the lowest possible level of risk for its level of return additionally , since each additional asset introduced into a portfolio further diversifies the portfolio , the optimal portfolio must comprise every asset , ( assuming no trading costs ) with each asset value-weighted to achieve the above ( assuming that any asset is infinitely divisible ) empirical studies show that low beta stocks may offer higher returns than the model would predict the model assumes that given a certain expected return , active and potential shareholders will prefer lower risk ( lower variance ) to higher risk and conversely given a certain level of risk will prefer higher returns to lower ones the market portfolio consists of all assets in all markets , where each asset is weighted by its market capitalization ) in practice , such a market portfolio is unobservable and people usually substitute a stock index as a proxy for the true market portfolio arbitrage pricing theory carhart four-factor model consumption beta ( ccapm ) fama–french three-factor model intertemporal capm ( icapm ) build-up method chance-constrained portfolio selection the capital asset pricing model : some empirical tests , pp

fischer black ( 1972 ) developed another version of capm , called black capm or zero-beta capm , that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset \right where p_t is the payoff of the asset or portfolio the capm returns the asset-appropriate required return or discount rate—i.e given the accepted concave utility function , the capm is consistent with intuition—investors ( should ) require a higher return for holding a more risky asset market risk , the market as a whole , by definition , has a beta of one the risk of a portfolio comprises systematic risk , also known as undiversifiable risk , and specific risk which is also known as idiosyncratic risk or diversifiable risk systematic risk refers to the risk common to all securities—i.e unsystematic risk can be diversified away to smaller levels by including a greater number of assets in the portfolio ( specific risks '' average out '' ) a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk , as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model therefore , the required return on an asset , that is , the return that compensates for risk taken , must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i.e in the capm context , portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i.e in other words , the beta of the portfolio is the defining factor in rewarding the systematic exposure taken by an investor the capm assumes that the risk-return profile of a portfolio can be optimized—an optimal portfolio displays the lowest possible level of risk for its level of return the traditional capm using historical data as the inputs to solve for a future return of asset i however , the history may not be sufficient to use for predicting the future and modern capm approaches have used betas that rely on future risk estimates the market portfolio consists of all assets in all markets , where each asset is weighted by its market capitalization empirical tests show market anomalies like the size and value effect that can not be explained by the capm the capital asset pricing model : some empirical tests , pp the treynor capital asset pricing model , journal of investment management , vol the capital asset pricing model ( capm ) , short-sale restrictions and related issues , journal of finance , 32 ( 177 ) stone , bernell k ( 1970 ) risk , return , and equilibrium : a general single-period theory of asset selection and capital-market equilibrium

fischer black ( 1972 ) developed another version of capm , called black capm or zero-beta capm , that does not assume the existence of a riskless asset the rate at which future cash flows produced by the asset should be discounted given that asset 's relative riskiness given the accepted concave utility function , the capm is consistent with intuition—investors ( should ) require a higher return for holding a more risky asset market risk , the market as a whole , by definition , has a beta of one stock market indices are frequently used as local proxies for the market—and in that case ( by definition ) have a beta of one the risk of a portfolio comprises systematic risk , also known as undiversifiable risk , and specific risk which is also known as idiosyncratic risk or diversifiable risk systematic risk refers to the risk common to all securities—i.e unsystematic risk is the risk associated with individual assets unsystematic risk can be diversified away to smaller levels by including a greater number of assets in the portfolio ( specific risks '' average out '' ) depending on the market , a portfolio of approximately 30–40 securities in developed markets such as the uk or us will render the portfolio sufficiently diversified such that risk exposure is limited to systematic risk only a rational investor should not take on any diversifiable risk , as only non-diversifiable risks are rewarded within the scope of this model therefore , the required return on an asset , that is , the return that compensates for risk taken , must be linked to its riskiness in a portfolio context—i.e in the capm context , portfolio risk is represented by higher variance i.e the capm assumes that the risk-return profile of a portfolio can be optimized—an optimal portfolio displays the lowest possible level of risk for its level of return the model assumes that all active and potential shareholders have access to the same information and agree about the risk and expected return of all assets ( homogeneous expectations assumption ) empirical studies show that low beta stocks may offer higher returns than the model would predict casino gamblers pay to take on more risk , and it is possible that some stock traders will pay for risk as well the market portfolio consists of all assets in all markets , where each asset is weighted by its market capitalization the market portfolio should in theory include all types of assets that are held by anyone as an investment ( including works of art , real estate , human capital however , others find that the choice of market portfolio may not be that important for empirical tests capm assumes that all active and potential shareholders will consider all of their assets and optimize one portfolio

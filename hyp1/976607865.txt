although all water bodies on the surface and in aquifers contain dissolved salts , the water must evaporate into the atmosphere for the minerals to precipitate this is usually an arid environment with a small basin fed by a limited input of water marine evaporites tend to have thicker deposits and are usually the focus of more extensive research at this point , the mineral gypsum begins to form , which is then followed by halite at 10 % , excluding carbonate minerals that tend not to be evaporites however , there are approximately 80 different minerals that have been reported found in evaporite deposits ( stewart , 1963 ; warren , 1999 ) , though only about a dozen are common enough to be considered important rock formers non-marine evaporites are usually composed of minerals that are not common in marine environments because in general the water from which non-marine evaporite precipitates has proportions of chemical elements different from those found in the marine environments non-marine deposits may also contain halite , gypsum , and anhydrite , and may in some cases even be dominated by these minerals , although they did not come from ocean deposits examples of modern non-marine depositional environments include the great salt lake in utah and the dead sea , which lies between jordan and israel this is a chart that shows minerals that form the marine evaporite rocks , they are usually the most common minerals that appear in this kind of deposit a common borate is borax , which has been used in soaps as a surfactant evaporite deposits cover large regions of titan 's surface , mainly along the coastlines of lakes or in isolated basins ( lacunae ) that are equivalent to salt pans on earth .

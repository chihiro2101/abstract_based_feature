formation of evaporite rocks although all water bodies on the surface and in aquifers contain dissolved salts , the water must evaporate into the atmosphere for the minerals to precipitate marine evaporites tend to have thicker deposits and are usually the focus of more extensive research the most common minerals that are generally considered to be the most representative of marine evaporites are calcite , gypsum and anhydrite , halite , sylvite , carnallite , langbeinite , polyhalite , and kainite non-marine evaporites are usually composed of minerals that are not common in marine environments because in general the water from which non-marine evaporite precipitates has proportions of chemical elements different from those found in the marine environments non-marine deposits may also contain halite , gypsum , and anhydrite , and may in some cases even be dominated by these minerals , although they did not come from ocean deposits this , however , does not make non-marine deposits any less important ; these deposits often help to paint a picture into past earth climates examples of modern non-marine depositional environments include the great salt lake in utah and the dead sea , which lies between jordan and israel in fact , most evaporite formations do not contain more than a few percent of evaporite minerals , the remainder being composed of the more typical detrital clastic rocks and carbonates this is a chart that shows minerals that form the marine evaporite rocks , they are usually the most common minerals that appear in this kind of deposit evaporite minerals start to precipitate when their concentration in water reaches such a level that they can no longer exist as solutes

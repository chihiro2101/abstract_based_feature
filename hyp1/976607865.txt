although all water bodies on the surface and in aquifers contain dissolved salts , the water must evaporate into the atmosphere for the minerals to precipitate this is usually an arid environment with a small basin fed by a limited input of water when scientists evaporate ocean water in a laboratory , the minerals are deposited in a defined order that was first demonstrated by usiglio in 1884 at this point , the mineral gypsum begins to form , which is then followed by halite at 10 % , excluding carbonate minerals that tend not to be evaporites non-marine evaporites are usually composed of minerals that are not common in marine environments because in general the water from which non-marine evaporite precipitates has proportions of chemical elements different from those found in the marine environments common minerals that are found in these deposits include bl√∂dite , borax , epsomite , gaylussite , glauberite , mirabilite , thenardite and trona non-marine deposits may also contain halite , gypsum , and anhydrite , and may in some cases even be dominated by these minerals , although they did not come from ocean deposits this , however , does not make non-marine deposits any less important ; these deposits often help to paint a picture into past earth climates evaporite minerals , especially nitrate minerals , are economically important in peru and chile this is a chart that shows minerals that form the marine evaporite rocks , they are usually the most common minerals that appear in this kind of deposit the minerals precipitate out of solution in the reverse order of their solubilities , such that the order of precipitation from sea water is : calcite ( caco 3 ) and dolomite ( camg ( co 3 ) 2 ) gypsum ( caso 4 and anhydrite ( caso 4 )

formation of evaporite rocks although all water bodies on the surface and in aquifers contain dissolved salts , the water must evaporate into the atmosphere for the minerals to precipitate at this point , the mineral gypsum begins to form , which is then followed by halite at 10 % , excluding carbonate minerals that tend not to be evaporites the most common minerals that are generally considered to be the most representative of marine evaporites are calcite , gypsum and anhydrite , halite , sylvite , carnallite , langbeinite , polyhalite , and kainite however , there are approximately 80 different minerals that have been reported found in evaporite deposits ( stewart , 1963 ; warren , 1999 ) , though only about a dozen are common enough to be considered important rock formers non-marine evaporites are usually composed of minerals that are not common in marine environments because in general the water from which non-marine evaporite precipitates has proportions of chemical elements different from those found in the marine environments common minerals that are found in these deposits include bl√∂dite , borax , epsomite , gaylussite , glauberite , mirabilite , thenardite and trona examples of modern non-marine depositional environments include the great salt lake in utah and the dead sea , which lies between jordan and israel in fact , most evaporite formations do not contain more than a few percent of evaporite minerals , the remainder being composed of the more typical detrital clastic rocks and carbonates this is a chart that shows minerals that form the marine evaporite rocks , they are usually the most common minerals that appear in this kind of deposit evaporite deposits cover large regions of titan 's surface , mainly along the coastlines of lakes or in isolated basins ( lacunae ) that are equivalent to salt pans on earth .

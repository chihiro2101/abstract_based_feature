menarche is the culmination of a series of physiological and anatomic processes of puberty : attainment of a sufficient body mass ( typically 17 % body fat ) over an interval of about 2 to 3 years , estrogen stimulates growth of the uterus ( as well as height growth , breast growth , widening of the pelvis , and increased regional adipose tissue ) death of some of the endometrial tissue from these hormone or blood supply fluctuations leads to deciduation , a sloughing of part of the lining with some blood flow from the vagina no specific hormonal signal for menarche is known ; menarche as a discrete event is thought to be the relatively chance result of the gradual thickening of the endometrium induced by rising but fluctuating pubertal estrogen in most girls , menarche does not mean that ovulation has occurred in postmenarchal girls , about 80 % of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche , 50 % in the third and 10 % in the sixth year on the other hand , not every girl follows the typical pattern , and some girls ovulate before the first menstruation although unlikely , it is possible for a girl who has engaged in sexual intercourse shortly before her menarche to conceive and become pregnant , which would delay her menarche until after the end of the pregnancy a young age at menarche is not correlated with a young age at first sexual intercourse when menarche occurs , it confirms that the girl has had a gradual estrogen-induced growth of the uterus , especially the endometrium , and that the '' outflow tract '' from the uterus , through the cervix to the vagina , is open in very rare instances , menarche may occur at an unusually early age , preceding thelarche and other signs of puberty isolated premature menarche is rarely the first manifestation of precocious puberty according to a review article , there may also be an association between early age at menarche and breast cancer risk studies have been conducted to observe the association of the timing of menarche with various conditions and diseases some studies have shown that there may be an association between early or late-age menarche and cardiovascular disease , although the mechanism of the association is not well understood a systematic review has concluded that early age at menarche is also a risk factor for the insulin resistance condition there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between obesity and timing of menarche ; a meta-analysis and systematic review has determined that more studies must be conducted to make any definitive conclusions about this association in most of these studies menarche was specifically examined , assuming it to be a valid '' proxy '' for the more general process of puberty some suggest that childhood stress is caused by precocious puberty recognized later , rather than being the cause of it thumb there were few systematic studies of timing of menarche before the later half of the 20th century this age at menarche is not much different ( 0.3 years earlier ) than that reported for u.s age at menarche for non-hispanic black girls was significantly earlier than that of white girls at 10 % , 25 % , and 50 % of those who had attained menarche , whereas non-white mexican american girls were only slightly earlier than the white girls at 25 % in some indian communities , young women are given a special menarche ceremony called ruthu sadangu historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model in nigeria , the tiv ethnic group scarification into the abdomen of their girls during menarche

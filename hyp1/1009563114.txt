menarche is the culmination of a series of physiological and anatomic processes of puberty : attainment of a sufficient body mass ( typically 17 % body fat ) over an interval of about 2 to 3 years , estrogen stimulates growth of the uterus ( as well as height growth , breast growth , widening of the pelvis , and increased regional adipose tissue ) no specific hormonal signal for menarche is known ; menarche as a discrete event is thought to be the relatively chance result of the gradual thickening of the endometrium induced by rising but fluctuating pubertal estrogen the initial flow of menarche is usually brighter than mature menstrual flow in most girls , menarche does not mean that ovulation has occurred in postmenarchal girls , about 80 % of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche , 50 % in the third and 10 % in the sixth year on the other hand , not every girl follows the typical pattern , and some girls ovulate before the first menstruation although unlikely , it is possible for a girl who has engaged in sexual intercourse shortly before her menarche to conceive and become pregnant , which would delay her menarche until after the end of the pregnancy this goes against the widely held assumption that a woman can not become pregnant until after menarche a young age at menarche is not correlated with a young age at first sexual intercourse in very rare instances , menarche may occur at an unusually early age , preceding thelarche and other signs of puberty this is termed isolated premature menarche , but other causes of vaginal bleeding must be investigated and excluded when menarche has failed to occur for more than three years after thelarche , or beyond 16 years of age , the delay is referred to as primary amenorrhea short stature , delayed growth in height and weight , and/or delayed menarche may be the only clinical manifestations of celiac disease , in absence of any other symptoms according to a review article , there may also be an association between early age at menarche and breast cancer risk studies have been conducted to observe the association of the timing of menarche with various conditions and diseases a systematic review has concluded that early age at menarche is also a risk factor for the insulin resistance condition there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between obesity and timing of menarche ; a meta-analysis and systematic review has determined that more studies must be conducted to make any definitive conclusions about this association the more dire social conditions have been found to be associated with delay of maturation , an effect that may be compounded by dietary inadequacy from the sixth to the fifteenth centuries in europe , most women reached menarche on average at about 14 , between the ages of 12 and 15 a 2011 study found that each 1 & nbsp ; kg/m 2 increase in childhood body-mass index ( bmi ) can be expected to result in a 6.5 % higher absolute risk of early menarche ( before age 12 years ) age at menarche for non-hispanic black girls was significantly earlier than that of white girls at 10 % , 25 % , and 50 % of those who had attained menarche , whereas non-white mexican american girls were only slightly earlier than the white girls at 25 % this party is similar to the quincea√±era in latin america , except that a specific age marks the transition rather than menarche in the united states , public schools have a sex education program that teaches girls about menstruation and what to expect at the onset of menarche ( often this takes place during the 4th grade ) the girls who experience menarche wear special clothes and style their hair like the navajo goddess '' changing woman ''

menarche is the culmination of a series of physiological and anatomic processes of puberty : attainment of a sufficient body mass ( typically 17 % body fat ) no specific hormonal signal for menarche is known ; menarche as a discrete event is thought to be the relatively chance result of the gradual thickening of the endometrium induced by rising but fluctuating pubertal estrogen the initial flow of menarche is usually brighter than mature menstrual flow in most girls , menarche does not mean that ovulation has occurred in postmenarchal girls , about 80 % of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche , 50 % in the third and 10 % in the sixth year continuing ovulation typically requires a body fat content of at least 22 % on the other hand , not every girl follows the typical pattern , and some girls ovulate before the first menstruation although unlikely , it is possible for a girl who has engaged in sexual intercourse shortly before her menarche to conceive and become pregnant , which would delay her menarche until after the end of the pregnancy this goes against the widely held assumption that a woman can not become pregnant until after menarche a young age at menarche is not correlated with a young age at first sexual intercourse in very rare instances , menarche may occur at an unusually early age , preceding thelarche and other signs of puberty this is termed isolated premature menarche , but other causes of vaginal bleeding must be investigated and excluded when menarche has failed to occur for more than three years after thelarche , or beyond 16 years of age , the delay is referred to as primary amenorrhea short stature , delayed growth in height and weight , and/or delayed menarche may be the only clinical manifestations of celiac disease , in absence of any other symptoms according to a review article , there may also be an association between early age at menarche and breast cancer risk studies have been conducted to observe the association of the timing of menarche with various conditions and diseases a systematic review has concluded that early age at menarche is also a risk factor for the insulin resistance condition there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between obesity and timing of menarche ; a meta-analysis and systematic review has determined that more studies must be conducted to make any definitive conclusions about this association some of the least understood environmental influences on timing of puberty are social and psychological thumb there were few systematic studies of timing of menarche before the later half of the 20th century from the sixth to the fifteenth centuries in europe , most women reached menarche on average at about 14 , between the ages of 12 and 15 girls are menstruating by 13.8 years of age , with a median age of 12.4 years this party is similar to the quincea√±era in latin america , except that a specific age marks the transition rather than menarche historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model the girls who experience menarche wear special clothes and style their hair like the navajo goddess '' changing woman ''

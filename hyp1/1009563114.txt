menarche is the culmination of a series of physiological and anatomic processes of puberty : attainment of a sufficient body mass ( typically 17 % body fat ) over an interval of about 2 to 3 years , estrogen stimulates growth of the uterus ( as well as height growth , breast growth , widening of the pelvis , and increased regional adipose tissue ) death of some of the endometrial tissue from these hormone or blood supply fluctuations leads to deciduation , a sloughing of part of the lining with some blood flow from the vagina no specific hormonal signal for menarche is known ; menarche as a discrete event is thought to be the relatively chance result of the gradual thickening of the endometrium induced by rising but fluctuating pubertal estrogen '' like other menses , menarche may be accompanied by abdominal pain in most girls , menarche does not mean that ovulation has occurred in postmenarchal girls , about 80 % of the cycles were anovulatory in the first year after menarche , 50 % in the third and 10 % in the sixth year although unlikely , it is possible for a girl who has engaged in sexual intercourse shortly before her menarche to conceive and become pregnant , which would delay her menarche until after the end of the pregnancy a young age at menarche is not correlated with a young age at first sexual intercourse in very rare instances , menarche may occur at an unusually early age , preceding thelarche and other signs of puberty this is termed isolated premature menarche , but other causes of vaginal bleeding must be investigated and excluded according to a review article , there may also be an association between early age at menarche and breast cancer risk studies have been conducted to observe the association of the timing of menarche with various conditions and diseases some studies have shown that there may be an association between early or late-age menarche and cardiovascular disease , although the mechanism of the association is not well understood a systematic review has concluded that early age at menarche is also a risk factor for the insulin resistance condition there is conflicting evidence regarding the association between obesity and timing of menarche ; a meta-analysis and systematic review has determined that more studies must be conducted to make any definitive conclusions about this association in comparison with the effects of genetics , nutrition , and general health , social influences are small , shifting timing by a few months rather than years lack of exercise in childhood other research has focused on the effect of childhood stress on timing of puberty , especially female statistical associations are not necessarily causal , and a variety of secondary variables and alternative explanations can be possibly intervening most sources agree that the average age of menarche in girls in modern societies has declined , though the reasons and the degree remain subjects of controversy age at menarche for non-hispanic black girls was significantly earlier than that of white girls at 10 % , 25 % , and 50 % of those who had attained menarche , whereas non-white mexican american girls were only slightly earlier than the white girls at 25 % in the united states , public schools have a sex education program that teaches girls about menstruation and what to expect at the onset of menarche ( often this takes place during the 4th grade ) historically menstruation has been a social taboo and girls were taught about menarche and menstruation by their mothers or a female role model the girls who experience menarche wear special clothes and style their hair like the navajo goddess '' changing woman '' carrie white experiences her first period as she showers after the school gym class , and unaware of what is happening to her , she panics and pleads for help , but the other girls respond by bullying her

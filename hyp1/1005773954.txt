the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the ultraviolet spectroscopy searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus , from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated the instrument used 2.9 watts , with an improved version onboard new horizons alice was built and operated by the southwest research institute for nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory the camera system had a narrow-angle lens ( 700 & nbsp ; mm ) and a wide-angle lens ( 140 & nbsp ; mm ) , with a 2048×2048 pixel ccd chip development and construction of the instrument was led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) the visible and ir spectrometer was able to make pictures of the nucleus in the ir and also search for ir spectra of molecules in the coma miro ( microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter ) the consert experiment provided information about the deep interior of the comet using radar the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus rsi made use of the probe 's communication system for physical investigation of the nucleus and the inner coma of the comet the high-resolution atomic force microscopy investigated several physical aspects of the dust particles which are deposited on a silicon plate cosima analysed the composition of dust particles by secondary ion mass spectrometry , using indium ions the cosima team is led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps , germany ) comets are thought to have delivered a vast quantity of water to earth , and they may have also seeded earth with organic molecules the virtis spectrometer on board the rosetta spacecraft has provided evidence of nonvolatile organic macromolecular compounds everywhere on the surface of comet 67p with little to no water ice visible in turn , the philae lander 's cosac instrument detected organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere as it descended to its surface ; 2005 4 march – rosetta executed its first planned close swing-by ( gravity assist passage ) of earth 4 july – imaging instruments on board observed the collision between the comet tempel 1 and the impactor of the deep impact mission 8 november – catalina sky survey briefly misidentified the rosetta spacecraft , approaching for its second earth flyby , as a newly discovered asteroid 6 august – rosetta arrives at 67p , approaching to and carrying out a thruster burn that reduces its relative velocity to 10 december 2014 – data from the rosina mass spectrometers show that the ratio of heavy water to normal water on comet 67p is more than three times that on earth 30 september 2016 - mission ended in an attempt to slow land on the comet 's surface near a wide pit called deir el-medina as part of the european space agency 's media campaign in support of the rosetta mission , both the rosetta and philae spacecraft were given anthropomorphic personalities in an animated web series titled once upon a time to promote the spacecraft 's arrival at comet 67p/churyumov–gerasimenko and the landing of philae in 2014 , a short film was produced by the european space agency with polish visual effects production company platige image file : chasing a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about rosetta mission ( 9 min

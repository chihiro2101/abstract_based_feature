the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the ultraviolet spectroscopy searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus , from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated the camera system had a narrow-angle lens ( 700 & nbsp ; mm ) and a wide-angle lens ( 140 & nbsp ; mm ) , with a 2048×2048 pixel ccd chip development and construction of the instrument was led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) the visible and ir spectrometer was able to make pictures of the nucleus in the ir and also search for ir spectra of molecules in the coma the detection was done by a mercury cadmium telluride array for ir and with a ccd chip for the visible spectrum range the instrument was produced in italy , and improved versions were used for dawn and venus express miro ( microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter ) the abundance and temperature of volatile substances like water , ammonia and carbon dioxide could be detected by miro via their microwave emissions the radio antenna along with the rest of the instrument was built by nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory with international contributions by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) , among others the consert experiment provided information about the deep interior of the comet using radar the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus development was led by the laboratoire de planétologie de grenoble with contributions by the ruhr-universität boch and the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) has contributed to the deveplopment and construction of the instrument cosima analysed the composition of dust particles by secondary ion mass spectrometry , using indium ions cosima was built by the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics ( mpe , germany ) with international contributions the cosima team is led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps , germany ) giada analysed the dust environment of the comet coma by measuring the optical cross section , momentum , speed and mass of each grain entering inside the instrument comets are thought to have delivered a vast quantity of water to earth , and they may have also seeded earth with organic molecules before succumbing to falling power levels , philae cosac instrument was able to detect organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere ; 2005 4 march – rosetta executed its first planned close swing-by ( gravity assist passage ) of earth the walls of the pit contain wide so-called '' goose bumps '' , believed to represent the building blocks of the comet as part of the european space agency 's media campaign in support of the rosetta mission , both the rosetta and philae spacecraft were given anthropomorphic personalities in an animated web series titled once upon a time canonically , rosetta and philae are depicted as siblings , with rosetta being the older sister , inspired by the spacecraft 's feminine name , of philae , her younger brother '' the film 's conception was the result of the bfi 's inquiry to the esa for a contribution to their celebration of science fiction , with the esa taking the opportunity to promote the rosetta mission through the festival file : chasing a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about rosetta mission ( 9 min

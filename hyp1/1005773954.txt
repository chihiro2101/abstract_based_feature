the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the ultraviolet spectroscopy searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus , from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated alice was built and operated by the southwest research institute for nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory development and construction of the instrument was led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) the visible and ir spectrometer was able to make pictures of the nucleus in the ir and also search for ir spectra of molecules in the coma the instrument was produced in italy , and improved versions were used for dawn and venus express miro ( microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter ) the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) has contributed to the deveplopment and construction of the instrument it could detect ions up to a mass of 6500 & nbsp ; amu cosima was built by the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics ( mpe , germany ) with international contributions comets are thought to have delivered a vast quantity of water to earth , and they may have also seeded earth with organic molecules before succumbing to falling power levels , philae cosac instrument was able to detect organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere the virtis spectrometer on board the rosetta spacecraft has provided evidence of nonvolatile organic macromolecular compounds everywhere on the surface of comet 67p with little to no water ice visible solid organic compounds were also found in the dust particles emitted by the comet ; the carbon in this organic material is bound in '' very large macromolecular compounds '' , analogous to those found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites in turn , the philae lander 's cosac instrument detected organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere as it descended to its surface one of the most outstanding discoveries of the mission was the detection of large amounts of free molecular oxygen gas surrounding the comet ; 2004 2 march – rosetta was successfully launched at 07:17 utc ( 04:17 local time ) from kourou , french guiana ; 2005 4 march – rosetta executed its first planned close swing-by ( gravity assist passage ) of earth 13 november – second earth swing-by at a minimum altitude of , travelling at commences comet mapping and characterisation to determine a stable orbit and viable landing location for philae 2 september 2016 - rosetta photographs the philae lander for the first time after its landing , finding it wedged against a large overhang as part of the european space agency 's media campaign in support of the rosetta mission , both the rosetta and philae spacecraft were given anthropomorphic personalities in an animated web series titled once upon a time '' the rosetta and philae characters featured in once upon a time on 23 september 2016 , vangelis released the studio album rosetta in honour of the mission , which was used on 30 september in the '' rosetta 's final hour '' streaming video of the esa livestream event '' rosetta grand finale '' file : chasing a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about rosetta mission ( 9 min

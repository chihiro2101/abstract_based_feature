the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the ultraviolet spectroscopy searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus , from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated the camera system had a narrow-angle lens ( 700 & nbsp ; mm ) and a wide-angle lens ( 140 & nbsp ; mm ) , with a 2048×2048 pixel ccd chip development and construction of the instrument was led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) the instrument was produced in italy , and improved versions were used for dawn and venus express miro ( microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter ) the radio antenna along with the rest of the instrument was built by nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory with international contributions by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) , among others the consert experiment provided information about the deep interior of the comet using radar the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus development was led by the laboratoire de planétologie de grenoble with contributions by the ruhr-universität boch and the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) rsi made use of the probe 's communication system for physical investigation of the nucleus and the inner coma of the comet the instrument consisted of a double-focus sector instrument ( dfms ) and a reflectron type time of flight ( rtof ) the dfms had a high resolution ( could resolve nitrogen from co ) for molecules up to 300 amu the high-resolution atomic force microscopy investigated several physical aspects of the dust particles which are deposited on a silicon plate the cosima team is led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps , germany ) before succumbing to falling power levels , philae cosac instrument was able to detect organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere the supernova could wipe out one type of molecules while also flinging the other surviving molecules into space , where they could eventually end up on a planet preliminary analyses strongly suggest the carbon is present as polyaromatic organic solids mixed with sulfides and iron-nickel alloys ; 2005 4 march – rosetta executed its first planned close swing-by ( gravity assist passage ) of earth 13 november – second earth swing-by at a minimum altitude of , travelling at 10 december 2014 – data from the rosina mass spectrometers show that the ratio of heavy water to normal water on comet 67p is more than three times that on earth ; 2015 14 april 2015 – scientists report that the comet 's nucleus has no magnetic field of its own 2 september 2016 - rosetta photographs the philae lander for the first time after its landing , finding it wedged against a large overhang the script for each episode of the series is written by science communicators at the european space research and technology centre , who kept close with mission operators and the producers at design & data on 23 september 2016 , vangelis released the studio album rosetta in honour of the mission , which was used on 30 september in the '' rosetta 's final hour '' streaming video of the esa livestream event '' rosetta grand finale '' file : chasing a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about rosetta mission ( 9 min

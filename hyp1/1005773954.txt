the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the ultraviolet spectroscopy searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus , from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated the visible and ir spectrometer was able to make pictures of the nucleus in the ir and also search for ir spectra of molecules in the coma miro ( microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter ) the radio antenna along with the rest of the instrument was built by nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory with international contributions by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) , among others the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus development was led by the laboratoire de planétologie de grenoble with contributions by the ruhr-universität boch and the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) the dfms had a high resolution ( could resolve nitrogen from co ) for molecules up to 300 amu the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) has contributed to the deveplopment and construction of the instrument cosima analysed the composition of dust particles by secondary ion mass spectrometry , using indium ions the cosima team is led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps , germany ) previous observations have shown that comets contain complex organic compounds these are the elements that make up nucleic acids and amino acids , essential ingredients for life as we know it comets are thought to have delivered a vast quantity of water to earth , and they may have also seeded earth with organic molecules before succumbing to falling power levels , philae cosac instrument was able to detect organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere ; amino acids upon landing on the comet , philae should have also tested some hypotheses as to why essential amino acids are almost all '' left-handed '' , which refers to how the atoms arrange in orientation in relation to the carbon core of the molecule the virtis spectrometer on board the rosetta spacecraft has provided evidence of nonvolatile organic macromolecular compounds everywhere on the surface of comet 67p with little to no water ice visible measurements by the cosac and ptolemy instruments on the philae lander revealed sixteen organic compounds , four of which were seen for the first time on a comet , including acetamide , acetone , methyl isocyanate and propionaldehyde the only amino acid detected thus far on the comet is glycine , along with the precursor molecules methylamine and ethylamine one of the most outstanding discoveries of the mission was the detection of large amounts of free molecular oxygen gas surrounding the comet 8 november – catalina sky survey briefly misidentified the rosetta spacecraft , approaching for its second earth flyby , as a newly discovered asteroid ; 2016 27 july 2016 – esa switched off the electrical support system processor unit ( ess ) aboard rosetta , disabling any possibility of further communications with the philae lander although philae sent back some data during its descent , rosetta has more powerful and more varied sensors and instruments , offering the opportunity to get some very close-in science to complement the more distant remote sensing it has been doing canonically , rosetta and philae are depicted as siblings , with rosetta being the older sister , inspired by the spacecraft 's feminine name , of philae , her younger brother ambition was premiered at the british film institute 's sci-fi : days of fear and wonder film festival in london on 24 october 2014 , three weeks before the landing of philae on 67p/churyumov–gerasimenko , 1080p hd , english ) file : landing on a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about philae landing ( 10 min

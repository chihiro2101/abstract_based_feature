the investigation of the nucleus was done by three optical spectrometers , one microwave radio antenna and one radar : alice ( an ultraviolet imaging spectrograph ) the ultraviolet spectroscopy searched for and quantified the noble gas content in the comet nucleus , from which the temperature during the comet creation could be estimated alice was built and operated by the southwest research institute for nasa 's jet propulsion laboratory the camera system had a narrow-angle lens ( 700 & nbsp ; mm ) and a wide-angle lens ( 140 & nbsp ; mm ) , with a 2048×2048 pixel ccd chip development and construction of the instrument was led by the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) the visible and ir spectrometer was able to make pictures of the nucleus in the ir and also search for ir spectra of molecules in the coma the instrument was produced in italy , and improved versions were used for dawn and venus express miro ( microwave instrument for the rosetta orbiter ) the abundance and temperature of volatile substances like water , ammonia and carbon dioxide could be detected by miro via their microwave emissions consert ( comet nucleus sounding experiment by radiowave transmission ) the consert experiment provided information about the deep interior of the comet using radar the radar performed tomography of the nucleus by measuring electromagnetic wave propagation between the philae lander and the rosetta orbiter through the comet nucleus the max planck institute for solar system research ( mps ) has contributed to the deveplopment and construction of the instrument cosima was built by the max planck institute for extraterrestrial physics ( mpe , germany ) with international contributions these are the elements that make up nucleic acids and amino acids , essential ingredients for life as we know it before succumbing to falling power levels , philae cosac instrument was able to detect organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere the virtis spectrometer on board the rosetta spacecraft has provided evidence of nonvolatile organic macromolecular compounds everywhere on the surface of comet 67p with little to no water ice visible solid organic compounds were also found in the dust particles emitted by the comet ; the carbon in this organic material is bound in '' very large macromolecular compounds '' , analogous to those found in carbonaceous chondrite meteorites in turn , the philae lander 's cosac instrument detected organic molecules in the comet 's atmosphere as it descended to its surface ; 2005 4 march – rosetta executed its first planned close swing-by ( gravity assist passage ) of earth the minimum altitude above the earth 's surface was 4 july – imaging instruments on board observed the collision between the comet tempel 1 and the impactor of the deep impact mission 2 september 2016 - rosetta photographs the philae lander for the first time after its landing , finding it wedged against a large overhang canonically , rosetta and philae are depicted as siblings , with rosetta being the older sister , inspired by the spacecraft 's feminine name , of philae , her younger brother the giotto spacecraft is also depicted as the duo 's grandfather , whereas others in the halley armada as well as nasa 's deep impact and stardust spacecraft are depicted as their cousins , 1080p hd , english ) file : landing on a comet - the rosetta mission.webm about philae landing ( 10 min

the term measurement traceability is used to refer to an unbroken chain of comparisons relating an instrument 's measurements to a known standard in many countries , national standards for weights and measures are maintained by a national metrological institute ( nmi ) which provides the highest level of standards for the calibration / measurement traceability infrastructure in that country in regard to materials , traceability refers to the capability to associate a finished part with destructive test results performed on material from the same ingot with the same heat treatment , or to associate a finished part with results of a test performed on a sample from the same melt identified by the unique lot number of the material a heat number is usually marked on the part or raw material which identifies the ingot it came from , and a lot number may identify the group of parts that experienced the same heat treatment ( i.e material traceability is important to the aerospace , nuclear , and process industry because they frequently make use of high strength materials that look identical to commercial low strength versions traceability is an important aspect for example in the automotive industry , where it makes recalls possible , or in the food industry where it contributes to food safety the international standards organization epcglobal under gs1 has ratified the epcglobal network standards ( especially the epc information services epcis standard ) which codify the syntax and semantics for supply chain events and the secure method for selectively sharing supply chain events with trading partners in food processing software , traceability systems imply the use of a unique piece of data ( e.g , order date/time or a serialized sequence number , generally through the use of a barcode / rfid ) which can be traced through the entire production flow , linking all sections of the business , including suppliers & future sales through the supply chain messages and files at any point in the system can then be audited for correctness and completeness , using the traceability software to find the particular transaction and/or product within the supply chain general food law food safety australia has its national livestock identification system to keep track of livestock from birth to slaughterhouse grapenet was designed and developed by logicsoft , case study - hortinet â€“ traceability system for horticulture products from india award-winning traceability solutions company , based in new delhi , india in systems and software development , the term traceability ( or requirements traceability ) refers to the ability to link product requirements back to stakeholders ' rationales and forward to corresponding design artifacts , code , and test cases . the world health organization has recognized the importance of traceability for medical products of human origin ( mpho ) and urged member states '' to encourage the implementation of globally consistent coding systems to facilitate national and international traceability '' national institute of standards and technology nist policy on traceability '' traceability '' from the global legal information network subject term index video which explains the relationship between calibration - traceability - accreditation with flow measuring devices technology tools in the health sector to control and improve the efficiency of their critical processes

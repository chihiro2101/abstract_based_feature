system dynamics is a methodology and mathematical modeling technique to frame , understand , and discuss complex issues and problems convenient graphical user interface ( gui ) system dynamics software developed into user friendly versions by the 1990s and have been applied to diverse systems system dynamics is an aspect of systems theory as a method to understand the dynamic behavior of complex systems system dynamics was created during the mid-1950s forrester , jay ( 1971 ) technology review 73 ( 3 ) : 52â€“68 by professor jay forrester of the massachusetts institute of technology forrester 's insights into the common foundations that underlie engineering , which led to the creation of system dynamics , were triggered , to a large degree , by his involvement with managers at general electric ( ge ) during the mid-1950s at that time , the managers at ge were perplexed because employment at their appliance plants in kentucky exhibited a significant three-year cycle these hand simulations were the start of the field of system dynamics forrester and the history of system dynamics '' during the late 1950s and early 1960s , forrester and a team of graduate students moved the emerging field of system dynamics from the hand-simulation stage to the formal computer modeling stage forrester published the first , and still classic , book in the field titled industrial dynamics in 1961 the urban dynamics model presented in the book was the first major non-corporate application of system dynamics at the bern meeting , forrester was asked if system dynamics could be used to address the predicament of mankind on the plane back from the bern meeting , forrester created the first draft of a system dynamics model of the world 's socioeconomic system the primary elements of system dynamics diagrams are feedback , accumulation of flows into stocks and time delays in the system dynamics methodology , a problem or a system ( e.g , ecosystem , political system or mechanical system ) may be represented as a causal loop diagram a causal loop diagram is a simple map of a system with all its constituent components and their interactions the second feedback loop on the left is negative reinforcement ( or '' balancing '' and hence labeled b ) system dynamics is very similar to systems thinking and constructs the same causal loop diagrams of systems with feedback this is also a common system dynamics diagramming convention system dynamic modeling : the system is now modeled , according to a stock and flow system dynamic logic department of energy 's introducing system dynamics - desert island dynamics '' an annotated survey of the essential system dynamics literature ''

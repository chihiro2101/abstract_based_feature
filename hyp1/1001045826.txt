analog to digital to optical photographic recording and playback system , march 1970 method and apparatus for synchronizing photographic records of digital information , march 1974 the compact disc is an evolution of laserdisc technology , where a focused laser beam is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals in 1979 , sony and philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc despite costing up to 1,000 , over 400,000 cd players were sold in the united states between 1983 and 1984 the success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between philips and sony , who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware the unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company , and allowed the cd to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged unlike early laserdisc players , first cd players already used laser diodes instead of larger helium-neon lasers ottens , director of the audio division of philips , started a small group with the aim to develop an analog optical audio disc with a diameter of and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record why cds may actually sound better than vinyl , chris kornelis , 27 january 2015 however , due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format , two philips research engineers recommended a digital format in march 1974 the diameter of philips 's prototype compact disc was set at , the diagonal of an audio cassette heitaro nakajima , who developed an early digital audio recorder within japan 's national public broadcasting organization nhk in 1970 , became general manager of sony 's audio department in 1971 sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in september 1976 technical details of sony 's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd aes convention , held on 13–16 march 1979 , in brussels a week later , on 8 march , philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called '' philips introduce compact disc '' in eindhoven , netherlands sony executive norio ohga , later ceo and chairman of sony , and heitaro nakajima were convinced of the format 's commercial potential and pushed further development despite widespread skepticism led by engineers kees schouhamer immink and toshitada doi , the research pushed forward laser and optical disc technology first published in 1980 , the standard was formally adopted by the iec as an international standard in 1987 , with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996 philips coined the term compact disc in line with another audio product , the compact cassette , and contributed the general manufacturing process , based on video laserdisc technology philips also contributed eight-to-fourteen modulation ( efm ) , which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints , while sony contributed the error-correction method , circ the task force consisted of around four to eight persons , though according to philips , the compact disc was '' invented collectively by a large group of people working as a team first red book cds and players “ red book ” was the first standard in the rainbow books series of standards the cd was planned to be the successor of the gramophone record for playing music , rather than primarily as a data storage medium , but from its origins as a format for music , its use has grown to encompass other applications recordable cds were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without the defects introduced in the compression used in other digital recording methods other newer video formats such as dvd and blu-ray use the same physical geometry as cd , and most dvd and blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio cd some cd players incorporate disc changers also , the user can manually choose the disc to be played , making it similar to a jukebox as of 2020 , compact cassettes , vinyl records , and cds are still being released by some musicians , primarily as merchandise , to allow fans to provide financial support while receiving something tangible in return the process of playing an audio cd , touted as a digital audio storage medium , starts with the plastic polycarbonate compact disc , a medium that contains the digitally encoded data analogue signal recovery from the disc to read the data from the disc , a laser beam shines on the surface of the disc quark 1998 another servo mechanism in the player is in charge of keeping the focused beam centered on the data track the other design by sony uses a diffraction grating to part the laser light into one main beam and two sub-beams the servo detects the rf signal being received on the peripheral receivers and the difference in output between these two diodes conform the tracking error signal that the system uses to keep the optics in the proper track the tracking signal is fed to two systems , one integrated in the focus lens assembly can do fine tracking correction and the other system can move the entire optical assembly side by side to do coarse track jumps the sum of the output from the four photodiodes makes the rf or high frequency signal which is an electronic mirror of the pits and lands recorded on the disc the rf signal , when observed on an oscilloscope , has a characteristic '' fish-eye '' pattern and its usefulness in servicing the machine is paramount for detecting and diagnosing problems , and calibrating cd players for operation using various circuits like a simple comparator or a data slicer , the analog signal becomes a chain of two binary digital values , 1 and 0 the second stage is demodulating the efm signal into a data frame that contains the audio samples , error correction parity bits , according with the circ error correction code , and control data for the player display and micro-computer during the launch of the first prototype '' goronta '' cd player by sony at the japanese audio fair in 1982 , sony showcased the vertical loading design philips cd100 player '' - marantz-philips nederlands website '' the history of the cd - the introduction '' , philips research a cd player has three major mechanical components : a drive motor , a lens system or pickup head , and a tracking mechanism yet others are related to the cd player 's intended target , such as anti-skip for car and portable cd players , pitch control and queuing for a dj 's cd player , remote and system integration for household players the d-50 was made available on the market in 1984 , and adopted for sony 's entire portable cd player line djs who use cds and cd players typically use specialized dj cd players that have features not available on regular cd players

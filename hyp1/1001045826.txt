method and apparatus for synchronizing photographic records of digital information , march 1974 following litigation , sony and philips licensed russell 's patents ( then held by a canadian company , optical recording corp the compact disc is an evolution of laserdisc technology , where a focused laser beam is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals in 1979 , sony and philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc after their commercial release in 1982 , compact discs and their players were extremely popular despite costing up to 1,000 , over 400,000 cd players were sold in the united states between 1983 and 1984 the unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company , and allowed the cd to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged the sony cdp-101 , released in 1982 , was the world 's first commercially released compact disc player unlike early laserdisc players , first cd players already used laser diodes instead of larger helium-neon lasers ottens , director of the audio division of philips , started a small group with the aim to develop an analog optical audio disc with a diameter of and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record why cds may actually sound better than vinyl , chris kornelis , 27 january 2015 however , due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format , two philips research engineers recommended a digital format in march 1974 in 1977 , philips then established a laboratory with the mission of creating a digital audio disc the diameter of philips 's prototype compact disc was set at , the diagonal of an audio cassette heitaro nakajima , who developed an early digital audio recorder within japan 's national public broadcasting organization nhk in 1970 , became general manager of sony 's audio department in 1971 his team developed a digital pcm adaptor audio tape recorder using a betamax video recorder in 1973 in september 1978 , the company demonstrated an optical digital audio disc with a 150-minute playing time , 44,056 & nbsp ; hz sampling rate , 16-bit linear resolution , and cross-interleaved error correction code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980 technical details of sony 's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd aes convention , held on 13–16 march 1979 , in brussels a week later , on 8 march , philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called '' philips introduce compact disc '' in eindhoven , netherlands sony executive norio ohga , later ceo and chairman of sony , and heitaro nakajima were convinced of the format 's commercial potential and pushed further development despite widespread skepticism as a result , in 1979 , sony and philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc the first public demonstration was on the bbc television program tomorrow 's world in 1981 , when the bee gees ' album living eyes ( 1981 ) was played the first 50 titles were released in japan on 1 october 1982 , with the first-cataloged cd in this wave being a reissue of billy joel 's 52nd street the new audio disc was enthusiastically received , especially in the early-adopting classical music and audiophile communities , and its handling quality received particular praise currently , with the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players , such as mobile phones , and solid state music storage , cd players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs and connections to usb devices commonly these can hold 3 or 5 discs at once and change from one disc to the next without user intervention some could also play dvd and blu-ray discs meanwhile , with the advent and popularity of digital distribution of files in lossy compression audio formats such as mp3 , sales of cds began to decline in the 2000s the disc is placed in a tray which either opens up ( as with portable cd players ) or slides out ( the norm with in-home cd players , computer disc drives and game consoles ) in some systems , the user slides the disc into a slot ( e.g , car stereo cd players ) once the disc is loaded into the tray , the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the spiral data track using a laser beam to read the data from the disc , a laser beam shines on the surface of the disc a low mass lens coupled to an electromagnetic coil is in charge of keeping focused the beam on the 600 & nbsp ; nm wide data track on most players , the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes the other design by sony uses a diffraction grating to part the laser light into one main beam and two sub-beams when focused , the two peripheral beams cover the border of the adjacent tracks a few micrometres apart from the main beam and reflect back on two photodiodes separated from the main block of four the rf signal , when observed on an oscilloscope , has a characteristic '' fish-eye '' pattern and its usefulness in servicing the machine is paramount for detecting and diagnosing problems , and calibrating cd players for operation using various circuits like a simple comparator or a data slicer , the analog signal becomes a chain of two binary digital values , 1 and 0 this signal carries all the information in a cd and is modulated using a system called efm ( eight-to-fourteen modulation ) the second stage is demodulating the efm signal into a data frame that contains the audio samples , error correction parity bits , according with the circ error correction code , and control data for the player display and micro-computer the audio cd format requires every player to have enough processing power to decode the cd data ; this is normally made by application-specific integrated circuits ( asics ) the top-loading disc tray design is also used in most fifth-generation video game consoles ( the playstation , the sega saturn and the 3do interactive multiplayer ) , as well as the sega dreamcast , the nintendo gamecube and the wii mini they were also the first to use a design in which the audio electronics were in a separate enclosure from the cd drive and pickup mechanism yet others are related to the cd player 's intended target , such as anti-skip for car and portable cd players , pitch control and queuing for a dj 's cd player , remote and system integration for household players after apple computer entered the music player market with its ipod line , within ten years it became the dominant seller of portable digital audio players , '' djs who use cds and cd players typically use specialized dj cd players that have features not available on regular cd players

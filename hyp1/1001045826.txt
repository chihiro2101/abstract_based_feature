russell is known for inventing the first system to record digital information on an optical transparent foil that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp analog to digital to optical photographic recording and playback system , march 1970 following litigation , sony and philips licensed russell 's patents ( then held by a canadian company , optical recording corp in 1979 , sony and philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc after their commercial release in 1982 , compact discs and their players were extremely popular the success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between philips and sony , who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware the unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company , and allowed the cd to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged unlike early laserdisc players , first cd players already used laser diodes instead of larger helium-neon lasers ottens , director of the audio division of philips , started a small group with the aim to develop an analog optical audio disc with a diameter of and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record why cds may actually sound better than vinyl , chris kornelis , 27 january 2015 however , due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format , two philips research engineers recommended a digital format in march 1974 heitaro nakajima , who developed an early digital audio recorder within japan 's national public broadcasting organization nhk in 1970 , became general manager of sony 's audio department in 1971 after this , in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in september 1976 a year later , in september 1977 , sony showed the press a disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio ( 44,100 & nbsp ; hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution ) using mfm modulation a week later , on 8 march , philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called '' philips introduce compact disc '' in eindhoven , netherlands as a result , in 1979 , sony and philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc after a year of experimentation and discussion , the task force produced the red book cd-da standard philips coined the term compact disc in line with another audio product , the compact cassette , and contributed the general manufacturing process , based on video laserdisc technology philips established the polydor pressing operations plant in langenhagen near hannover , germany , and quickly passed a series of milestones the new audio disc was enthusiastically received , especially in the early-adopting classical music and audiophile communities , and its handling quality received particular praise as the price of players gradually came down , and with the introduction of the portable walkman , the cd began to gain popularity in the larger popular and rock music markets the cd was planned to be the successor of the gramophone record for playing music , rather than primarily as a data storage medium , but from its origins as a format for music , its use has grown to encompass other applications in 1983 , following the cd 's introduction , immink and braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd aes convention in 1988 as part of the joint philips-sony development effort recordable cds were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without the defects introduced in the compression used in other digital recording methods other newer video formats such as dvd and blu-ray use the same physical geometry as cd , and most dvd and blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio cd by the early 2000s , the cd player had largely replaced the audio cassette player as standard equipment in new automobiles , with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the us to have a factory-equipped cassette player in japan , however , over 80 percent of music was bought on cds and other physical formats as of 2015 , car stereo cd players ) different brands and models of optical assemblies use different methods of focus detection egon strauss - compact disc , digital storage medium , ed the other design by sony uses a diffraction grating to part the laser light into one main beam and two sub-beams when focused , the two peripheral beams cover the border of the adjacent tracks a few micrometres apart from the main beam and reflect back on two photodiodes separated from the main block of four the tracking signal is fed to two systems , one integrated in the focus lens assembly can do fine tracking correction and the other system can move the entire optical assembly side by side to do coarse track jumps the efm demodulator also decodes part of the cd signal and routes it to the proper circuits , separating audio , parity and control ( subcode ) data after demodulating , a circ error corrector takes each audio data frame , stores it in a sram memory and verifies that it has been read correctly , if it is not , it takes the parity and correction bits and fixes the data , then it moves it out to a dac to be converted to an analog audio signal if too many data frames are missing or unrecoverable , the audio signal may be impossible to fix by interpolation , so an audio mute flag is raised to mute the dac to avoid invalid data to be played back the audio cd format requires every player to have enough processing power to decode the cd data ; this is normally made by application-specific integrated circuits ( asics ) for the early vertical loading players , alpine sourced their ad-7100 player designs for luxman , kenwood and toshiba ( using their aurex brand ) philips cd100 player '' - marantz-philips nederlands website '' the history of the cd - the introduction '' , philips research top-loading was adopted on various equipment designs such as mini systems and portable cd players , but among stereo component cd players , only a handful of top-loading models have been made by using a higher sampling frequency , a multiple of the 44.1 & nbsp ; khz used by cd encoding , it can employ a filter with much lower requirements anti-skip or antishock , is a way for the cd player to avoid interrupting the audio output when mechanical shock is experienced by the disc playback mechanism in 1998 , portable mp3 players began to compete with portable cd players while former giant sony ( maker of the portable walkman and cd discman was struggling djs who use cds and cd players typically use specialized dj cd players that have features not available on regular cd players

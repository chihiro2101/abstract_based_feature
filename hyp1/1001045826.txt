russell is known for inventing the first system to record digital information on an optical transparent foil that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp following litigation , sony and philips licensed russell 's patents ( then held by a canadian company , optical recording corp the compact disc is an evolution of laserdisc technology , where a focused laser beam is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals after their commercial release in 1982 , compact discs and their players were extremely popular despite costing up to 1,000 , over 400,000 cd players were sold in the united states between 1983 and 1984 the unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company , and allowed the cd to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged the sony cdp-101 , released in 1982 , was the world 's first commercially released compact disc player unlike early laserdisc players , first cd players already used laser diodes instead of larger helium-neon lasers . digital audio laser-disc prototypes ottens , director of the audio division of philips , started a small group with the aim to develop an analog optical audio disc with a diameter of and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record why cds may actually sound better than vinyl , chris kornelis , 27 january 2015 however , due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format , two philips research engineers recommended a digital format in march 1974 the diameter of philips 's prototype compact disc was set at , the diagonal of an audio cassette heitaro nakajima , who developed an early digital audio recorder within japan 's national public broadcasting organization nhk in 1970 , became general manager of sony 's audio department in 1971 after this , in 1974 the leap to storing digital audio on an optical disc was easily made sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in september 1976 a week later , on 8 march , philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called '' philips introduce compact disc '' in eindhoven , netherlands as a result , in 1979 , sony and philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc first published in 1980 , the standard was formally adopted by the iec as an international standard in 1987 , with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996 philips also contributed eight-to-fourteen modulation ( efm ) , which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints , while sony contributed the error-correction method , circ the first commercial compact disc was produced on 17 august 1982 the first popular music cd produced at the new factory was the visitors ( 1981 ) by abba the japanese launch was followed in march 1983 by the introduction of cd players and discs to europe '' philips celebrates 25th anniversary of the compact disc '' , philips media release , 16 august 2007 the new audio disc was enthusiastically received , especially in the early-adopting classical music and audiophile communities , and its handling quality received particular praise the first artist to sell a million copies on cd was dire straits , with their 1985 album brothers in arms maxim , 2004 the first major artist to have his entire catalogue converted to cd was david bowie , whose 15 studio albums were made available by rca records in february 1985 , along with four greatest hits albums in 1983 , following the cd 's introduction , immink and braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd aes convention other newer video formats such as dvd and blu-ray use the same physical geometry as cd , and most dvd and blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio cd by the early 2000s , the cd player had largely replaced the audio cassette player as standard equipment in new automobiles , with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the us to have a factory-equipped cassette player some cd players incorporate disc changers they were often built into car audio and home stereo systems , although a 7 disc cd changer was once made by nec for pcs , car stereo cd players ) once the disc is loaded into the tray , the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the spiral data track using a laser beam on most players , the focus position detection is made using the difference in the current output of a block of four photodiodes that difference is the information that the servoamplifier uses to keep the lens at the proper reading distance during the playback operation , even if the disc is warped two optical pick-up designs exists , the original cdm series from philips use a magnetic actuator mounted on a swing-arm to do coarse and fine tracking the rf signal , when observed on an oscilloscope , has a characteristic '' fish-eye '' pattern and its usefulness in servicing the machine is paramount for detecting and diagnosing problems , and calibrating cd players for operation using various circuits like a simple comparator or a data slicer , the analog signal becomes a chain of two binary digital values , 1 and 0 this signal carries all the information in a cd and is modulated using a system called efm ( eight-to-fourteen modulation ) the efm demodulator also decodes part of the cd signal and routes it to the proper circuits , separating audio , parity and control ( subcode ) data the redbook standard dictates that , if there is invalid , erroneous or missing audio data , it can not be output to the speakers as digital noise , it has to be muted later , meridian introduced their mcd '' high end '' cd player , with meridian electronics in the philips cd100 chassis basically as the tray came out to collect the cd , the entire player 's transport system also came out as one unit it also uses another magnetic movement mechanism attached to the focusing lens to focus the laser beam on the disc surface some players may compress the audio data prior to buffering to use lower capacity ( and less expensive ) ram chips '' this market shift was initiated when the first portable digital audio player , the rio digital music player , was introduced djs who use cds and cd players typically use specialized dj cd players that have features not available on regular cd players

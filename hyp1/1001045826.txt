russell is known for inventing the first system to record digital information on an optical transparent foil that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp analog to digital to optical photographic recording and playback system , march 1970 following litigation , sony and philips licensed russell 's patents ( then held by a canadian company , optical recording corp the compact disc is an evolution of laserdisc technology , where a focused laser beam is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals in 1979 , sony and philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc despite costing up to 1,000 , over 400,000 cd players were sold in the united states between 1983 and 1984 the success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between philips and sony , who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware the unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company , and allowed the cd to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged unlike early laserdisc players , first cd players already used laser diodes instead of larger helium-neon lasers why cds may actually sound better than vinyl , chris kornelis , 27 january 2015 however , due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format , two philips research engineers recommended a digital format in march 1974 his team developed a digital pcm adaptor audio tape recorder using a betamax video recorder in 1973 sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in september 1976 a year later , in september 1977 , sony showed the press a disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio ( 44,100 & nbsp ; hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution ) using mfm modulation technical details of sony 's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd aes convention , held on 13–16 march 1979 , in brussels a week later , on 8 march , philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called '' philips introduce compact disc '' in eindhoven , netherlands first published in 1980 , the standard was formally adopted by the iec as an international standard in 1987 , with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996 philips coined the term compact disc in line with another audio product , the compact cassette , and contributed the general manufacturing process , based on video laserdisc technology philips also contributed eight-to-fourteen modulation ( efm ) , which offers a certain resilience to defects such as scratches and fingerprints , while sony contributed the error-correction method , circ the compact disc story , told by a former member of the task force , gives background information on the many technical decisions made , including the choice of the sampling frequency , playing time , and disc diameter philips established the polydor pressing operations plant in langenhagen near hannover , germany , and quickly passed a series of milestones the first public demonstration was on the bbc television program tomorrow 's world in 1981 , when the bee gees ' album living eyes ( 1981 ) was played the first 50 titles were released in japan on 1 october 1982 , with the first-cataloged cd in this wave being a reissue of billy joel 's 52nd street the japanese launch was followed in march 1983 by the introduction of cd players and discs to europe '' philips celebrates 25th anniversary of the compact disc '' , philips media release , 16 august 2007 the cd was planned to be the successor of the gramophone record for playing music , rather than primarily as a data storage medium , but from its origins as a format for music , its use has grown to encompass other applications the world 's first cd-r was made by the japanese firm taiyo yuden co recordable cds were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without the defects introduced in the compression used in other digital recording methods other newer video formats such as dvd and blu-ray use the same physical geometry as cd , and most dvd and blu-ray players are backward compatible with audio cd the process of playing an audio cd , touted as a digital audio storage medium , starts with the plastic polycarbonate compact disc , a medium that contains the digitally encoded data to read the data from the disc , a laser beam shines on the surface of the disc surface differences between discs being played , and tiny position differences once loaded , are handled by using a movable lens with a very close focal length to focus the light on the disc two optical pick-up designs exists , the original cdm series from philips use a magnetic actuator mounted on a swing-arm to do coarse and fine tracking using only one laser beam and the 4 photodiode block , the servo knows if the track is centred by measuring side-by-side movement of the light of beam hitting on the block and corrects to keep the light on the centre the servo detects the rf signal being received on the peripheral receivers and the difference in output between these two diodes conform the tracking error signal that the system uses to keep the optics in the proper track the tracking signal is fed to two systems , one integrated in the focus lens assembly can do fine tracking correction and the other system can move the entire optical assembly side by side to do coarse track jumps the first stage in the processing chain for the analog rf signal ( from the photoreceptor device ) is digitizing it the efm demodulator also decodes part of the cd signal and routes it to the proper circuits , separating audio , parity and control ( subcode ) data after demodulating , a circ error corrector takes each audio data frame , stores it in a sram memory and verifies that it has been read correctly , if it is not , it takes the parity and correction bits and fixes the data , then it moves it out to a dac to be converted to an analog audio signal asics do not work by themselves , however ; they require a main microcomputer or microcontroller to orchestrate the entire machine sony released its cdp-101 cd player in 1982 with a slide-out tray design for the cd as it was easy to manufacture and to use , most cd player manufacturers stayed with the tray style ever since during the launch of the first prototype '' goronta '' cd player by sony at the japanese audio fair in 1982 , sony showcased the vertical loading design for the early vertical loading players , alpine sourced their ad-7100 player designs for luxman , kenwood and toshiba ( using their aurex brand ) the radial mechanism , designed by sony , which is the one used in most cd players in the 2000s – the lens moves on a radial rail being driven by a rotating gear from a motor or a linear magnetic assembly '' this market shift was initiated when the first portable digital audio player , the rio digital music player , was introduced the boombox cd player is the only type of cd player which produces sound audible by the listener independently , without the need for headphones or an additional amplifier or speaker system djs who use cds and cd players typically use specialized dj cd players that have features not available on regular cd players

russell is known for inventing the first system to record digital information on an optical transparent foil that is lit from behind by a high-power halogen lamp analog to digital to optical photographic recording and playback system , march 1970 following litigation , sony and philips licensed russell 's patents ( then held by a canadian company , optical recording corp the compact disc is an evolution of laserdisc technology , where a focused laser beam is used that enables the high information density required for high-quality digital audio signals in 1979 , sony and philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new digital audio disc after their commercial release in 1982 , compact discs and their players were extremely popular despite costing up to 1,000 , over 400,000 cd players were sold in the united states between 1983 and 1984 the unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company , and allowed the cd to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged the sony cdp-101 , released in 1982 , was the world 's first commercially released compact disc player unlike early laserdisc players , first cd players already used laser diodes instead of larger helium-neon lasers ottens , director of the audio division of philips , started a small group with the aim to develop an analog optical audio disc with a diameter of and a sound quality superior to that of the vinyl record why cds may actually sound better than vinyl , chris kornelis , 27 january 2015 however , due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format , two philips research engineers recommended a digital format in march 1974 his team developed a digital pcm adaptor audio tape recorder using a betamax video recorder in 1973 sony first publicly demonstrated an optical digital audio disc in september 1976 technical details of sony 's digital audio disc were presented during the 62nd aes convention , held on 13–16 march 1979 , in brussels a week later , on 8 march , philips publicly demonstrated a prototype of an optical digital audio disc at a press conference called '' philips introduce compact disc '' in eindhoven , netherlands led by engineers kees schouhamer immink and toshitada doi , the research pushed forward laser and optical disc technology first published in 1980 , the standard was formally adopted by the iec as an international standard in 1987 , with various amendments becoming part of the standard in 1996 first red book cds and players “ red book ” was the first standard in the rainbow books series of standards the first 50 titles were released in japan on 1 october 1982 , with the first-cataloged cd in this wave being a reissue of billy joel 's 52nd street the japanese launch was followed in march 1983 by the introduction of cd players and discs to europe '' philips celebrates 25th anniversary of the compact disc '' , philips media release , 16 august 2007 the new audio disc was enthusiastically received , especially in the early-adopting classical music and audiophile communities , and its handling quality received particular praise maxim , 2004 the first major artist to have his entire catalogue converted to cd was david bowie , whose 15 studio albums were made available by rca records in february 1985 , along with four greatest hits albums in 1983 , following the cd 's introduction , immink and braat presented the first experiments with erasable compact discs during the 73rd aes convention in june 1985 , the computer-readable cd-rom ( read-only memory ) was introduced and , in 1990 , the cd-recordable , also developed by both sony and philips in 1988 as part of the joint philips-sony development effort recordable cds were a new alternative to tape for recording music and copying music albums without the defects introduced in the compression used in other digital recording methods by the early 2000s , the cd player had largely replaced the audio cassette player as standard equipment in new automobiles , with 2010 being the final model year for any car in the us to have a factory-equipped cassette player currently , with the increasing popularity of portable digital audio players , such as mobile phones , and solid state music storage , cd players are being phased out of automobiles in favor of minijack auxiliary inputs and connections to usb devices commonly these can hold 3 or 5 discs at once and change from one disc to the next without user intervention in japan , however , over 80 percent of music was bought on cds and other physical formats as of 2015 the process of playing an audio cd , touted as a digital audio storage medium , starts with the plastic polycarbonate compact disc , a medium that contains the digitally encoded data the disc is placed in a tray which either opens up ( as with portable cd players ) or slides out ( the norm with in-home cd players , computer disc drives and game consoles ) once the disc is loaded into the tray , the data is read out by a mechanism that scans the spiral data track using a laser beam surface differences between discs being played , and tiny position differences once loaded , are handled by using a movable lens with a very close focal length to focus the light on the disc a low mass lens coupled to an electromagnetic coil is in charge of keeping focused the beam on the 600 & nbsp ; nm wide data track when focused , the two peripheral beams cover the border of the adjacent tracks a few micrometres apart from the main beam and reflect back on two photodiodes separated from the main block of four the first stage in the processing chain for the analog rf signal ( from the photoreceptor device ) is digitizing it this signal carries all the information in a cd and is modulated using a system called efm ( eight-to-fourteen modulation ) the audio cd format requires every player to have enough processing power to decode the cd data ; this is normally made by application-specific integrated circuits ( asics ) top-loading was adopted on various equipment designs such as mini systems and portable cd players , but among stereo component cd players , only a handful of top-loading models have been made used in earliest philips cd players and later replaced with cheaper radial mechanisms the laser reads information by focusing a beam on the cd , which is reflected off the disc 's mirrored surface back to a photodiode array sensor most boomboxes from the 2010s typically include a cd player compatible with cd-r and cd-rw , which allows the user to carry their own music compilations on a higher fidelity medium djs who use cds and cd players typically use specialized dj cd players that have features not available on regular cd players

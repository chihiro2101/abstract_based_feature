in the early 1980s , most home computers manufactured in japan such as the nec pc-6001 and pc-8000 series , fujitsu 's fm-7 and fm-8 , and hitachi 's basic master featured a variant of the microsoft basic interpreter integrated into their on-board roms other japanese consumer electronics firms such as panasonic , canon , casio , yamaha , pioneer , and sanyo were searching for ways to enter the new home computer market major japanese electronics companies entered the computer market in the 1960s , and panasonic ( matsushita electric industrial ) was also developing mainframe computers however , during the japanese economy faced a recession after the 1964 summer olympics , panasonic decided to exit the computer business , and focused on home appliances in the late 1970s , the company intended to open new business other than home appliances at the same time , spectravideo contacted microsoft in order to obtain a software for their new home computer nishi wanted to involve panasonic and sony in the development of home computers idei thought sony should cooperate with panasonic on its development because the smc-70 , sony 's first personal computer , faced difficulty in the market when sony started the computer business nishi proposed msx as an attempt to create a single industry standard for home computers inspired by the success of vhs as a standard for video cassette recorders , many japanese electronic manufacturers along with goldstar , philips and spectravideo built and promoted msx computers any piece of hardware or software with the msx logo on it was compatible with msx products of other manufacturers to reduce overall system cost , many msx models used a custom ic known as '' msx-engine '' , which integrated glue logic , 8255 ppi , ym2149 compatible soundchip and more , sometimes even the z80 cpu however , almost all msx systems used a professional keyboard instead of a chiclet keyboard , driving the price up compared to the original sv-328 consequently , these components alongside microsoft 's msx basic made the msx a competitive , though somewhat expensive , home computer package spectravideo 's msx enjoyed very little success , and yamaha 's cx5m model , built to interface with various types of midi equipment , was billed more as a digital music tool than a standard personal computer the first three , msx ( 1983 ) , msx2 ( 1985 ) , and msx2+ ( 1988 ) , were all 8-bit computers based on the z80 microprocessor & nbsp ; 90 ) in its place , the msx turbor was released , which used the new custom 16-bit r800 microprocessor developed by ascii corporation intended for the msx3 , but features such as dma and 24-bit addressing were disabled by the time the msx turbor standard was announced in 1990 , only panasonic was manufacturing msx computers in total , 9 million msx computers were sold in japan , making it relatively popular this is the only official msx emulator as all msx copyrights are maintained by the msx association the new msx system is housed in a box made out of transparent blue plastic , and can be used with a standard monitor ( or tv ) and a pc keyboard at that time , the website of the msx licensing corporation that they linked to as source , had a text saying 'we are planning to revitalize msx , the innovative computer platform on july 4 , 2008 , msx association 's european contact website , which states to be the '' only official contact place for msx association in europe '' , reports that the msx trademark and copyright has been under the msx licensing corporation holding ever since 1983 like the latest zemmix game consoles , it is also based on a raspberry pi card with additional circuitry to connect the original msx peripherals the msx resource center the msx files scroll issue 12 : introducing msx msxtoday - community dedicated to msx standard computers

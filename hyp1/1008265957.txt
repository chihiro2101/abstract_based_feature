the schools were attached to cathedrals and monasteries , teaching latin – the language of the church – to future priests and monks with the foundation of the ancient universities from the late 12th century , grammar schools became the entry point to a liberal arts education , with latin seen as the foundation of the trivium pupils were usually educated in grammar schools up to the age of 14 , after which they would look to universities and the church for further study three of the first schools independent of the church – winchester college ( 1382 ) , oswestry school ( 1407 ) and eton college ( 1440 ) – were closely tied to the universities ; they were boarding schools , so they could educate pupils from anywhere in the nation . early modern grammar schools an example of an early grammar school , founded by an early modern borough corporation unconnected with church , or university , is bridgnorth grammar school , founded in 1503 by bridgnorth borough corporation king edward vi made an important contribution to grammar schools , founding a series of schools during his reign ( see king edward 's school ) king james i founded a series of '' royal schools '' in ulster , beginning with the royal school , armagh in the scottish reformation schools such as the high school of glasgow ( founded 1124 ) and the royal high school ( edinburgh ) ( 1128 ) passed from church control to burgh councils , and the burghs also founded new schools many of these are still commemorated in annual '' founder 's day '' services and ceremonies at surviving schools in 1755 samuel johnson 's dictionary defined a grammar school as a school in which the learned languages are grammatically taught ; however , by this time demand for these languages had fallen greatly in scotland , the burgh councils updated the curricula of their schools so that scotland no longer has grammar schools in any of the senses discussed here , though some , such as aberdeen grammar school , retain the name in england , urban middle-class pressure for a commercial curriculum was often supported by the school 's trustees ( who would charge the new students fees ) , but resisted by the schoolmaster , supported by the terms of the original endowment very few schools were able to obtain special acts of parliament to change their statutes ; examples are the macclesfield grammar school act 1774 and the bolton school act 1788 grammar schools were reinvented as academically oriented secondary schools following literary or scientific curricula , while often retaining classical subjects at the same time , the national schools were reorganising themselves along the lines of thomas arnold 's reforms at rugby school , and the spread of the railways led to new boarding schools teaching a broader curriculum , such as marlborough college ( 1843 ) the first girls ' schools targeted at university entrance were north london collegiate school ( 1850 ) and cheltenham ladies ' college ( from the appointment of dorothea beale in 1858 ) the result was the endowed schools act 1869 , which created the endowed schools commission with extensive powers over endowments of individual schools across england and wales schools endowed to offer free classical instruction to boys were remodelled as fee-paying schools ( with a few competitive scholarships ) teaching broad curricula to boys or girls these newer schools tended to emulate the great public schools , copying their curriculum , ethos and ambitions , and often took the title '' grammar school '' for historical reasons grammar schools thus emerged as one part of the highly varied education system of england and wales before 1944 the 1944 education act created the first nationwide system of state-funded secondary education in england and wales , echoed by the education ( northern ireland ) act 1947 one of the three types of school forming the tripartite system was called the grammar school , which sought to spread the academic ethos of the existing grammar schools grammar schools were intended to teach an academic curriculum to the most intellectually able 25 percent of the school population as selected by the 11-plus examination two types of grammar schools existed under the system : there were more than 1,200 maintained grammar schools , which were fully state-funded there were also 179 direct-grant grammar schools , which took between one quarter and one-half of their pupils from the state system , and the rest from fee-paying parents they also exercised far greater freedom from local authorities , and were members of the headmasters ' conference in contrast , very few students at secondary modern schools took public examinations until the introduction of the less academic and less prestigious certificate of secondary education ( known as the cse ) in the 1960s most maintained grammar schools were amalgamated with a number of other local schools , to form neighbourhood comprehensive schools , though a few were closed in england , implementation was less even , with some counties and individual schools successfully resisting conversion or closure the direct grant grammar schools ( cessation of grant ) regulations 1975 required direct grant schools to decide whether to convert into comprehensives under local authority control or become independent schools funded entirely by fees of the direct grant schools remaining at that time , 51 became comprehensive , 119 opted for independence , and five were '' not accepted for the maintained system and expected to become independent schools or to close '' some of these schools retained the name '' grammar '' in their title but are no longer free of charge for all but a few pupils these schools normally select their pupils by an entrance examination and sometimes by interview by the end of the 1980s , all of the grammar schools in wales and most of those in england had closed or converted while many former grammar schools ceased to be selective , many of these also retained the name '' grammar '' most of these schools remain comprehensive , though a few became partially selective or fully selective in the 1990s under the labour government 's school standards and framework act 1998 , grammar schools were for the first time to be designated by statutory instrument the education ( grammar school designation ) order 1998 , statutory instrument 1998 no the education ( grammar school designation ) ( amendment ) order 1999 , statutory instrument 1999 no petitions were launched in several areas , but only one received the signatures of 20 % of eligible parents , the level needed to trigger a ballot bbc : family and education : 8 september 2016 only a few areas have kept a formal grammar school system along the lines of the tripartite system further radical change was opposed by both conservative and labour governments until september 2016 in queensland , the grammar schools act 1860 provided for the state-assisted foundation of non-denominational grammar schools grammar schools on the english and later british models were founded during the colonial period , the first being the boston latin school , founded as the latin grammar school in 1635 in 1888 auckland girls ' grammar school was established in 1922 mount albert grammar school was established as part of auckland grammar school

although the term scolae grammaticales was not widely used until the 14th century , the earliest such schools appeared from the sixth century , e.g the king 's school , canterbury ( founded 597 ) and the king 's school , rochester ( 604 ) the schools were attached to cathedrals and monasteries , teaching latin – the language of the church – to future priests and monks with the foundation of the ancient universities from the late 12th century , grammar schools became the entry point to a liberal arts education , with latin seen as the foundation of the trivium three of the first schools independent of the church – winchester college ( 1382 ) , oswestry school ( 1407 ) and eton college ( 1440 ) – were closely tied to the universities ; they were boarding schools , so they could educate pupils from anywhere in the nation . early modern grammar schools an example of an early grammar school , founded by an early modern borough corporation unconnected with church , or university , is bridgnorth grammar school , founded in 1503 by bridgnorth borough corporation mason , the borough of bridgnorth 1157–1957 ( bridgnorth , 1957 ) , 12 , 36 during the english reformation in the 16th century , most cathedral schools were closed and replaced by new foundations funded from the dissolution of the monasteries king edward vi made an important contribution to grammar schools , founding a series of schools during his reign ( see king edward 's school ) a few grammar schools were also established in the name of queen mary and queen elizabeth i in theory these schools were open to all and offered free tuition to those who could not pay fees ; however , few poor children attended school , because their labour was economically valuable to their families in the scottish reformation schools such as the high school of glasgow ( founded 1124 ) and the royal high school ( edinburgh ) ( 1128 ) passed from church control to burgh councils , and the burghs also founded new schools many of these are still commemorated in annual '' founder 's day '' services and ceremonies at surviving schools by the end of their studies at age 14 , they would be quite familiar with the great latin authors , and with latin drama and rhetoric other skills , such as arithmetic and handwriting , were taught in odd moments or by travelling specialist teachers such as scriveners in 1755 samuel johnson 's dictionary defined a grammar school as a school in which the learned languages are grammatically taught ; however , by this time demand for these languages had fallen greatly most grammar schools founded in the 18th century also taught arithmetic and english in scotland , the burgh councils updated the curricula of their schools so that scotland no longer has grammar schools in any of the senses discussed here , though some , such as aberdeen grammar school , retain the name very few schools were able to obtain special acts of parliament to change their statutes ; examples are the macclesfield grammar school act 1774 and the bolton school act 1788 the 19th century saw a series of reforms to grammar schools , culminating in the endowed schools act 1869 grammar schools were reinvented as academically oriented secondary schools following literary or scientific curricula , while often retaining classical subjects the grammar schools act 1840 made it lawful to apply the income of grammar schools to purposes other than the teaching of classical languages , but change still required the consent of the schoolmaster at the same time , the national schools were reorganising themselves along the lines of thomas arnold 's reforms at rugby school , and the spread of the railways led to new boarding schools teaching a broader curriculum , such as marlborough college ( 1843 ) modelled on the clarendon commission , which led to the public schools act 1868 which restructured the trusts of nine leading schools ( including eton college , harrow school and shrewsbury school ) , the taunton commission was appointed to examine the remaining 782 endowed grammar schools the result was the endowed schools act 1869 , which created the endowed schools commission with extensive powers over endowments of individual schools a girls ' grammar school established in a town with an older boys ' grammar school would often be named a '' high school '' under the education ( administrative provisions ) act 1907 all grant-aided secondary schools were required to provide at least 25 percent of their places as free scholarships for students from public elementary schools grammar schools thus emerged as one part of the highly varied education system of england and wales before 1944 the 1944 education act created the first nationwide system of state-funded secondary education in england and wales , echoed by the education ( northern ireland ) act 1947 grammar schools were intended to teach an academic curriculum to the most intellectually able 25 percent of the school population as selected by the 11-plus examination two types of grammar schools existed under the system : there were more than 1,200 maintained grammar schools , which were fully state-funded these schools included some very old schools encouraged to participate in the tripartite system the most famous example of a direct-grant grammar was manchester grammar school , whose headmaster , lord james of rusholme , was one of the most outspoken advocates of the tripartite system these schools were also the only ones that offered an extra term of school to prepare pupils for the competitive entrance exams for oxford and cambridge most maintained grammar schools were amalgamated with a number of other local schools , to form neighbourhood comprehensive schools , though a few were closed these schools normally select their pupils by an entrance examination and sometimes by interview while many former grammar schools ceased to be selective , many of these also retained the name '' grammar '' the tripartite system of grammar and secondary modern schools does survive in a few areas , such as kent , where the eleven-plus examination to divide children into grammar and secondary modern schools is known as the kent test today , '' grammar school '' commonly refers to one of the 163 remaining fully selective state-funded schools in england and the 69 remaining in northern ireland under the labour government 's school standards and framework act 1998 , grammar schools were for the first time to be designated by statutory instrument bbc : family and education : 8 september 2016 only a few areas have kept a formal grammar school system along the lines of the tripartite system early examples include launceston grammar school ( 1846 ) , pulteney grammar school ( 1847 ) , geelong grammar school ( 1855 ) , melbourne grammar school ( 1858 ) and hale school ( 1858 ) in the 1920s grammar schools of other denominations were established , including members of the associated grammar schools of victoria , mccallum ( 1990 ) , p in recognition of the broad curricula offered , grammar schools were redesignated as secondary school by the act to improve the common and grammar schools of the province of ontario of 1871 such schools include bandon grammar school , drogheda grammar school , dundalk grammar school and sligo grammar school grammar schools on the english and later british models were founded during the colonial period , the first being the boston latin school , founded as the latin grammar school in 1635 gymnasium ( school ) middle school anatolian high school debates on the grammar school history of education in england latin school list of english and welsh endowed schools ( 19th century )

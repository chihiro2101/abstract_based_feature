the schools were attached to cathedrals and monasteries , teaching latin – the language of the church – to future priests and monks with the foundation of the ancient universities from the late 12th century , grammar schools became the entry point to a liberal arts education , with latin seen as the foundation of the trivium pupils were usually educated in grammar schools up to the age of 14 , after which they would look to universities and the church for further study an example of an early grammar school , founded by an early modern borough corporation unconnected with church , or university , is bridgnorth grammar school , founded in 1503 by bridgnorth borough corporation mason , the borough of bridgnorth 1157–1957 ( bridgnorth , 1957 ) , 12 , 36 during the english reformation in the 16th century , most cathedral schools were closed and replaced by new foundations funded from the dissolution of the monasteries king edward vi made an important contribution to grammar schools , founding a series of schools during his reign ( see king edward 's school ) a few grammar schools were also established in the name of queen mary and queen elizabeth i in theory these schools were open to all and offered free tuition to those who could not pay fees ; however , few poor children attended school , because their labour was economically valuable to their families in the scottish reformation schools such as the high school of glasgow ( founded 1124 ) and the royal high school ( edinburgh ) ( 1128 ) passed from church control to burgh councils , and the burghs also founded new schools the teaching of these languages was hampered by a shortage of non-latin type and of teachers fluent in the languages many of these are still commemorated in annual '' founder 's day '' services and ceremonies at surviving schools the usual pattern was to create an endowment to pay the wages of a master to instruct local boys in latin and sometimes greek without charge grammar schools in the 18th and 19th centuries most grammar schools founded in the 18th century also taught arithmetic and english in scotland , the burgh councils updated the curricula of their schools so that scotland no longer has grammar schools in any of the senses discussed here , though some , such as aberdeen grammar school , retain the name very few schools were able to obtain special acts of parliament to change their statutes ; examples are the macclesfield grammar school act 1774 and the bolton school act 1788 at the same time , the national schools were reorganising themselves along the lines of thomas arnold 's reforms at rugby school , and the spread of the railways led to new boarding schools teaching a broader curriculum , such as marlborough college ( 1843 ) the commission proposed the creation of a national system of secondary education by restructuring the endowments of these schools for modern purposes the result was the endowed schools act 1869 , which created the endowed schools commission with extensive powers over endowments of individual schools across england and wales schools endowed to offer free classical instruction to boys were remodelled as fee-paying schools ( with a few competitive scholarships ) teaching broad curricula to boys or girls a girls ' grammar school established in a town with an older boys ' grammar school would often be named a '' high school '' under the education ( administrative provisions ) act 1907 all grant-aided secondary schools were required to provide at least 25 percent of their places as free scholarships for students from public elementary schools one of the three types of school forming the tripartite system was called the grammar school , which sought to spread the academic ethos of the existing grammar schools grammar schools were intended to teach an academic curriculum to the most intellectually able 25 percent of the school population as selected by the 11-plus examination though some were quite old , most were either newly created or built since the victorian period , seeking to replicate the studious , aspirational atmosphere found in the older grammar schools there were also 179 direct-grant grammar schools , which took between one quarter and one-half of their pupils from the state system , and the rest from fee-paying parents these schools included some very old schools encouraged to participate in the tripartite system the most famous example of a direct-grant grammar was manchester grammar school , whose headmaster , lord james of rusholme , was one of the most outspoken advocates of the tripartite system initially , they studied for the school certificate and higher school certificate , replaced in 1951 by general certificate of education examinations at o-level ( ordinary level ) and a-level ( advanced level ) in contrast , very few students at secondary modern schools took public examinations until the introduction of the less academic and less prestigious certificate of secondary education ( known as the cse ) in the 1960s anatomy of britain today , london : hodder and stoughton , 1965 , p.195 the tripartite system was largely abolished in england and wales between 1965 , with the issue of circular 10/65 , and the education act 1976 most maintained grammar schools were amalgamated with a number of other local schools , to form neighbourhood comprehensive schools , though a few were closed of the direct grant schools remaining at that time , 51 became comprehensive , 119 opted for independence , and five were '' not accepted for the maintained system and expected to become independent schools or to close '' some of these schools retained the name '' grammar '' in their title but are no longer free of charge for all but a few pupils by the end of the 1980s , all of the grammar schools in wales and most of those in england had closed or converted the tripartite system of grammar and secondary modern schools does survive in a few areas , such as kent , where the eleven-plus examination to divide children into grammar and secondary modern schools is known as the kent test current british grammar schools today , '' grammar school '' commonly refers to one of the 163 remaining fully selective state-funded schools in england and the 69 remaining in northern ireland the national grammar schools association campaigns in favour of such schools , welcome to the national grammar schools association while comprehensive future and the campaign for state education campaign against them however the party 's manifesto for the 1997 election promised that '' any changes in the admissions policies of grammar schools will be decided by local parents under the labour government 's school standards and

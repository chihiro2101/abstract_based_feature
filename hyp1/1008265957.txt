they were boarding schools , so they could educate pupils from anywhere in the nation an example of an early grammar school , founded by an early modern borough corporation unconnected with church , or university , is bridgnorth grammar school , founded in 1503 by bridgnorth borough corporation for example , the oldest extant schools in wales – christ college , brecon ( founded 1541 ) and the friars school , bangor ( 1557 ) – were established on the sites of former dominican monasteries king edward vi made an important contribution to grammar schools , founding a series of schools during his reign ( see king edward 's school ) in the scottish reformation schools such as the high school of glasgow ( founded 1124 ) and the royal high school ( edinburgh ) ( 1128 ) passed from church control to burgh councils , and the burghs also founded new schools in 1755 samuel johnson 's dictionary defined a grammar school as a school in which the learned languages are grammatically taught ;

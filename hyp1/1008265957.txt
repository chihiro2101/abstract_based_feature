the schools were attached to cathedrals and monasteries , teaching latin – the language of the church – to future priests and monks with the foundation of the ancient universities from the late 12th century , grammar schools became the entry point to a liberal arts education , with latin seen as the foundation of the trivium three of the first schools independent of the church – winchester college ( 1382 ) , oswestry school ( 1407 ) and eton college ( 1440 ) – were closely tied to the universities ; they were boarding schools , so they could educate pupils from anywhere in the nation . early modern grammar schools an example of an early grammar school , founded by an early modern borough corporation unconnected with church , or university , is bridgnorth grammar school , founded in 1503 by bridgnorth borough corporation king edward vi made an important contribution to grammar schools , founding a series of schools during his reign ( see king edward 's school ) king james i founded a series of '' royal schools '' in ulster , beginning with the royal school , armagh in theory these schools were open to all and offered free tuition to those who could not pay fees ; however , few poor children attended school , because their labour was economically valuable to their families in the scottish reformation schools such as the high school of glasgow ( founded 1124 ) and the royal high school ( edinburgh ) ( 1128 ) passed from church control to burgh councils , and the burghs also founded new schools the usual pattern was to create an endowment to pay the wages of a master to instruct local boys in latin and sometimes greek without charge grammar schools in the 18th and 19th centuries most grammar schools founded in the 18th century also taught arithmetic and english in scotland , the burgh councils updated the curricula of their schools so that scotland no longer has grammar schools in any of the senses discussed here , though some , such as aberdeen grammar school , retain the name after 10 years , lord eldon , then lord chancellor , ruled in 1805 , '' there is no authority for thus changing the nature of the charity , and filling a school intended for the purpose of teaching greek and latin with scholars learning the german and french languages , mathematics , and anything except greek and latin grammar schools were reinvented as academically oriented secondary schools following literary or scientific curricula , while often retaining classical subjects at the same time , the national schools were reorganising themselves along the lines of thomas arnold 's reforms at rugby school , and the spread of the railways led to new boarding schools teaching a broader curriculum , such as marlborough college ( 1843 ) the commission reported that the distribution of schools did not match the current population , and that provision varied greatly in quality , with provision for girls being particularly limited the commission proposed the creation of a national system of secondary education by restructuring the endowments of these schools for modern purposes the result was the endowed schools act 1869 , which created the endowed schools commission with extensive powers over endowments of individual schools across england and wales schools endowed to offer free classical instruction to boys were remodelled as fee-paying schools ( with a few competitive scholarships ) teaching broad curricula to boys or girls in the victorian era there was a great emphasis on the importance of self-improvement , and parents keen for their children to receive a decent education organised the creation of new schools with modern curricula , though often retaining a classical core these newer schools tended to emulate the great public schools , copying their curriculum , ethos and ambitions , and often took the title '' grammar school '' for historical reasons a girls ' grammar school established in a town with an older boys ' grammar school would often be named a '' high school '' under the education ( administrative provisions ) act 1907 all grant-aided secondary schools were required to provide at least 25 percent of their places as free scholarships for students from public elementary schools grammar schools thus emerged as one part of the highly varied education system of england and wales before 1944 the 1944 education act created the first nationwide system of state-funded secondary education in england and wales , echoed by the education ( northern ireland ) act 1947 grammar schools were intended to teach an academic curriculum to the most intellectually able 25 percent of the school population as selected by the 11-plus examination most maintained grammar schools were amalgamated with a number of other local schools , to form neighbourhood comprehensive schools , though a few were closed in england , implementation was less even , with some counties and individual schools successfully resisting conversion or closure some of these schools retained the name '' grammar '' in their title but are no longer free of charge for all but a few pupils by the end of the 1980s , all of the grammar schools in wales and most of those in england had closed or converted while many former grammar schools ceased to be selective , many of these also retained the name '' grammar '' the tripartite system of grammar and secondary modern schools does survive in a few areas , such as kent , where the eleven-plus examination to divide children into grammar and secondary modern schools is known as the kent test current british grammar schools today , '' grammar school '' commonly refers to one of the 163 remaining fully selective state-funded schools in england and the 69

community schools founded since the introduction of universal secondary education in the republic by minister donogh o'malley in september 1967 other , less elitist , state schools were called simply '' secondary schools '' , similar to the uk equivalent of '' comprehensive schools '' after the 1990s all schools were integrated into a unified national school system , but the elite schools distinguished themselves by descriptions such as '' independent '' or '' autonomous '' an analogous concept to the contemporary english grammar school is the magnet school , a state-funded secondary institution that may select students from a given school district according to academic criteria in 1917 auckland grammar school 's sister school was established—epsom girls ' grammar school

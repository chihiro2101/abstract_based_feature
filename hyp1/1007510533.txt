aristotle mentioned the ability of the octopus to change colour for both camouflage and signalling in his historia animalium ( ca 400 bc ) : aristotle abstract google books giosu√® sangiovanni was the first to describe invertebrate pigment-bearing cells as in an italian science journal in 1819 the term chromatophore was adopted ( following sangiovanni 's chromoforo ) as the name for pigment-bearing cells derived from the neural crest of cold-blooded vertebrates and cephalopods in contrast , the word chromatocyte meaning '' cell '' ) was adopted for the cells responsible for colour found in birds and mammals this classification system persists to this day , even though the biochemistry of the pigments may be more useful to a scientific understanding of how the cells function structural colours are produced by various combinations of diffraction , reflection or scattering of light from structures with a scale around a quarter of the wavelength of light whereas all chromatophores contain pigments or reflecting structures ( except when there has been a mutation , as in albinism ) , not all pigment-containing cells are chromatophores it is found primarily in red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) , which are generated in bone marrow throughout the life of an organism , rather than being formed during embryological development however , vesicles containing pteridine and carotenoids are sometimes found in the same cell , in which case the overall colour depends on the ratio of red and yellow pigments iridophores , sometimes also called guanophores , are chromatophores that reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine when illuminated they generate iridescent colours because of the constructive interference of light unlike iridophores , however , leucophores have more organized crystals that reduce diffraction melanophores contain eumelanin , a type of melanin , that appears black or dark-brown because of its light absorbing qualities humans have only one class of pigment cell , the mammalian equivalent of melanophores , to generate skin , hair , and eye colour although they appear unusual in their limited taxonomic range , there may be cyanophores ( as well as further unusual chromatophore types ) in other fish and amphibians for example , brightly coloured chromatophores with undefined pigments are found in both poison dart frogs and glass frogs , and atypical dichromatic chromatophores , named erythro-iridophores have been described in pseudochromis diadema many species are able to translocate the pigment inside their chromatophores , resulting in an apparent change in body colour this process , known as physiological colour change , is most widely studied in melanophores , since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment however , in animals with thick dermal layers , such as adult reptiles , dermal melanophores often form three-dimensional units with other chromatophores both types of melanophore are important in physiological colour change the control and mechanics of rapid pigment translocation has been well studied in a number of different species , in particular amphibians and teleost fish during vertebrate embryonic development , chromatophores are one of a number of cell types generated in the neural crest , a paired strip of cells arising at the margins of the neural tube studies using mutant fish have demonstrated that transcription factors such as kit , sox10 , and mitf are important in controlling chromatophore differentiation octopuses and most cuttlefish can operate chromatophores in complex , undulating chromatic displays , resulting in a variety of rapidly changing colour schemata

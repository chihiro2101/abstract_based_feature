aristotle mentioned the ability of the octopus to change colour for both camouflage and signalling in his historia animalium ( ca 400 bc ) : aristotle the term chromatophore was adopted ( following sangiovanni 's chromoforo ) as the name for pigment-bearing cells derived from the neural crest of cold-blooded vertebrates and cephalopods in contrast , the word chromatocyte meaning '' cell '' ) was adopted for the cells responsible for colour found in birds and mammals only one such cell type , the melanocyte , has been identified in these animals these pigments selectively absorb parts of the visible spectrum that makes up white light while permitting other wavelengths to reach the eye of the observer many such structures interfere with some wavelengths ( colours ) of light and transmit others , simply because of their scale , so they often produce iridescence , creating different colours when seen from different directions whereas all chromatophores contain pigments or reflecting structures ( except when there has been a mutation , as in albinism ) , not all pigment-containing cells are chromatophores chromatophores that contain large amounts of yellow pteridine pigments are named xanthophores ; those with mainly red/orange carotenoids are termed erythrophores the absence of carotene in the frogs ' diet meant that the red/orange carotenoid colour 'filter ' was not present in their erythrophores iridophores , sometimes also called guanophores , are chromatophores that reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine given a source of white light , they produce a white shine as with xanthophores and erythrophores , in fish the distinction between iridophores and leucophores is not always obvious , but , in general , iridophores are considered to generate iridescent or metallic colours , whereas leucophores produce reflective white hues when this protein is defective , no melanin can be generated resulting in certain types of albinism humans have only one class of pigment cell , the mammalian equivalent of melanophores , to generate skin , hair , and eye colour nearly all the vibrant blues in animals and plants are created by structural coloration rather than by pigments for example , brightly coloured chromatophores with undefined pigments are found in both poison dart frogs and glass frogs , and atypical dichromatic chromatophores , named erythro-iridophores have been described in pseudochromis diadema many species are able to translocate the pigment inside their chromatophores , resulting in an apparent change in body colour however , in animals with thick dermal layers , such as adult reptiles , dermal melanophores often form three-dimensional units with other chromatophores when the pigment is aggregated toward the centre of the cell , the pigments in other chromatophores are exposed to light and the skin takes on their hue fish melanophores and iridophores have been found to contain the smooth muscle regulatory proteins calponin and caldesmon it is known in zebrafish embryos , for example , that by 3 days after fertilization each of the cell classes found in the adult fish—melanophores , xanthophores and iridophores—are already present chromatophores are also used as a biomarker of blindness in cold-blooded species , as animals with certain visual defects fail to background adapt to light environments octopuses and most cuttlefish can operate chromatophores in complex , undulating chromatic displays , resulting in a variety of rapidly changing colour schemata the nerves that operate the chromatophores are thought to be positioned in the brain in a pattern isomorphic to that of the chromatophores they each control

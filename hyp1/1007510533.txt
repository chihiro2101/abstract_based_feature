aristotle mentioned the ability of the octopus to change colour for both camouflage and signalling in his historia animalium ( ca 400 bc ) : aristotle the term chromatophore was adopted ( following sangiovanni 's chromoforo ) as the name for pigment-bearing cells derived from the neural crest of cold-blooded vertebrates and cephalopods in contrast , the word chromatocyte meaning '' cell '' ) was adopted for the cells responsible for colour found in birds and mammals only one such cell type , the melanocyte , has been identified in these animals structural colours are produced by various combinations of diffraction , reflection or scattering of light from structures with a scale around a quarter of the wavelength of light whereas all chromatophores contain pigments or reflecting structures ( except when there has been a mutation , as in albinism ) , not all pigment-containing cells are chromatophores however , vesicles containing pteridine and carotenoids are sometimes found in the same cell , in which case the overall colour depends on the ratio of red and yellow pigments most chromatophores can generate pteridines from guanosine triphosphate , but xanthophores appear to have supplemental biochemical pathways enabling them to accumulate yellow pigment the absence of carotene in the frogs ' diet meant that the red/orange carotenoid colour 'filter ' was not present in their erythrophores when illuminated they generate iridescent colours because of the constructive interference of light like iridophores , they utilize crystalline purines ( often guanine ) to reflect light as with xanthophores and erythrophores , in fish the distinction between iridophores and leucophores is not always obvious , but , in general , iridophores are considered to generate iridescent or metallic colours , whereas leucophores produce reflective white hues humans have only one class of pigment cell , the mammalian equivalent of melanophores , to generate skin , hair , and eye colour for this reason , and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise , melanophores are by far the most widely studied chromatophore however , some types of synchiropus splendidus do possess vesicles of a cyan biochrome of unknown chemical structure in cells named cyanophores many species are able to translocate the pigment inside their chromatophores , resulting in an apparent change in body colour this process , known as physiological colour change , is most widely studied in melanophores , since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment however , in animals with thick dermal layers , such as adult reptiles , dermal melanophores often form three-dimensional units with other chromatophores as the other biochromatic chromatophores are also capable of pigment translocation , animals with multiple chromatophore types can generate a spectacular array of skin colours by making good use of the divisional effect the control and mechanics of rapid pigment translocation has been well studied in a number of different species , in particular amphibians and teleost fish most fish , reptiles and amphibians undergo a limited physiological colour change in response to a change in environment it is known in zebrafish embryos , for example , that by 3 days after fertilization each of the cell classes found in the adult fish—melanophores , xanthophores and iridophores—are already present coleoid cephalopods ( including octopuses , squids and cuttlefish ) have complex multicellular organs that they use to change colour rapidly , producing a wide variety of bright colours and patterns the nerves that operate the chromatophores are thought to be positioned in the brain in a pattern isomorphic to that of the chromatophores they each control

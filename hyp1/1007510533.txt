aristotle mentioned the ability of the octopus to change colour for both camouflage and signalling in his historia animalium ( ca 400 bc ) : aristotle the term chromatophore was adopted ( following sangiovanni 's chromoforo ) as the name for pigment-bearing cells derived from the neural crest of cold-blooded vertebrates and cephalopods in contrast , the word chromatocyte meaning '' cell '' ) was adopted for the cells responsible for colour found in birds and mammals it was only in the 1960s that chromatophores were well enough understood to enable them to be classified based on their appearance many such structures interfere with some wavelengths ( colours ) of light and transmit others , simply because of their scale , so they often produce iridescence , creating different colours when seen from different directions whereas all chromatophores contain pigments or reflecting structures ( except when there has been a mutation , as in albinism ) , not all pigment-containing cells are chromatophores chromatophores that contain large amounts of yellow pteridine pigments are named xanthophores ; those with mainly red/orange carotenoids are termed erythrophores therefore , the distinction between these chromatophore types is not always clear most chromatophores can generate pteridines from guanosine triphosphate , but xanthophores appear to have supplemental biochemical pathways enabling them to accumulate yellow pigment this made the frogs appear blue instead of green iridophores , sometimes also called guanophores , are chromatophores that reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine fish iridophores are typically stacked guanine plates separated by layers of cytoplasm to form microscopic , one-dimensional , bragg mirrors like iridophores , they utilize crystalline purines ( often guanine ) to reflect light humans have only one class of pigment cell , the mammalian equivalent of melanophores , to generate skin , hair , and eye colour for this reason , and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise , melanophores are by far the most widely studied chromatophore nearly all the vibrant blues in animals and plants are created by structural coloration rather than by pigments however , some types of synchiropus splendidus do possess vesicles of a cyan biochrome of unknown chemical structure in cells named cyanophores this process , known as physiological colour change , is most widely studied in melanophores , since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment when the pigment is aggregated toward the centre of the cell , the pigments in other chromatophores are exposed to light and the skin takes on their hue on the dispersion of melanin , the light is no longer scattered and the skin appears dark studies using mutant fish have demonstrated that transcription factors such as kit , sox10 , and mitf are important in controlling chromatophore differentiation chromatophore biology has also been used to model human condition or disease , including melanoma and albinism inside the chromatophore cell , pigment granules are enclosed in an elastic sac , called the cytoelastic sacculus the nerves that operate the chromatophores are thought to be positioned in the brain in a pattern isomorphic to that of the chromatophores they each control

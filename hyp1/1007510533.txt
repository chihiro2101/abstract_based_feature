aristotle mentioned the ability of the octopus to change colour for both camouflage and signalling in his historia animalium ( ca 400 bc ) : aristotle the term chromatophore was adopted ( following sangiovanni 's chromoforo ) as the name for pigment-bearing cells derived from the neural crest of cold-blooded vertebrates and cephalopods in contrast , the word chromatocyte meaning '' cell '' ) was adopted for the cells responsible for colour found in birds and mammals it was only in the 1960s that chromatophores were well enough understood to enable them to be classified based on their appearance this classification system persists to this day , even though the biochemistry of the pigments may be more useful to a scientific understanding of how the cells function these pigments selectively absorb parts of the visible spectrum that makes up white light while permitting other wavelengths to reach the eye of the observer many such structures interfere with some wavelengths ( colours ) of light and transmit others , simply because of their scale , so they often produce iridescence , creating different colours when seen from different directions whereas all chromatophores contain pigments or reflecting structures ( except when there has been a mutation , as in albinism ) , not all pigment-containing cells are chromatophores it is found primarily in red blood cells ( erythrocytes ) , which are generated in bone marrow throughout the life of an organism , rather than being formed during embryological development chromatophores that contain large amounts of yellow pteridine pigments are named xanthophores ; those with mainly red/orange carotenoids are termed erythrophores iridophores , sometimes also called guanophores , are chromatophores that reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine fish iridophores are typically stacked guanine plates separated by layers of cytoplasm to form microscopic , one-dimensional , bragg mirrors unlike iridophores , however , leucophores have more organized crystals that reduce diffraction as with xanthophores and erythrophores , in fish the distinction between iridophores and leucophores is not always obvious , but , in general , iridophores are considered to generate iridescent or metallic colours , whereas leucophores produce reflective white hues for example , a novel deep ( wine ) red-colour pigment was identified in the melanophores of phyllomedusinae while it is likely that other lesser-studied species have complex melanophore pigments , it is nevertheless true that the majority of melanophores studied to date do contain eumelanin exclusively for this reason , and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise , melanophores are by far the most widely studied chromatophore however , some types of synchiropus splendidus do possess vesicles of a cyan biochrome of unknown chemical structure in cells named cyanophores although they appear unusual in their limited taxonomic range , there may be cyanophores ( as well as further unusual chromatophore types ) in other fish and amphibians this process , known as physiological colour change , is most widely studied in melanophores , since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment these cells have the ability to migrate long distances , allowing chromatophores to populate many organs of the body , including the skin , eye , ear , and brain if these proteins are defective , chromatophores may be regionally or entirely absent , resulting in a leucistic disorder coleoid cephalopods ( including octopuses , squids and cuttlefish ) have complex multicellular organs that they use to change colour rapidly , producing a wide variety of bright colours and patterns like chameleons , cephalopods use physiological signalling theory

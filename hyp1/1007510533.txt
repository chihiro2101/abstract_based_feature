the word itself comes from the greek words meaning '' colour , '' and meaning '' bearing '' in contrast , the word chromatocyte meaning '' cell '' ) was adopted for the cells responsible for colour found in birds and mammals this classification system persists to this day , even though the biochemistry of the pigments may be more useful to a scientific understanding of how the cells function these pigments selectively absorb parts of the visible spectrum that makes up white light while permitting other wavelengths to reach the eye of the observer structural colours are produced by various combinations of diffraction , reflection or scattering of light from structures with a scale around a quarter of the wavelength of light whereas all chromatophores contain pigments or reflecting structures ( except when there has been a mutation , as in albinism ) , not all pigment-containing cells are chromatophores therefore , erythrocytes are not classified as chromatophores chromatophores that contain large amounts of yellow pteridine pigments are named xanthophores ; those with mainly red/orange carotenoids are termed erythrophores however , vesicles containing pteridine and carotenoids are sometimes found in the same cell , in which case the overall colour depends on the ratio of red and yellow pigments this was first demonstrated by rearing normally green frogs on a diet of carotene-restricted crickets iridophores , sometimes also called guanophores , are chromatophores that reflect light using plates of crystalline chemochromes made from guanine by using biochromes as coloured filters , iridophores create an optical effect known as tyndall or rayleigh scattering , producing bright-blue or -green colours given a source of white light , they produce a white shine as with xanthophores and erythrophores , in fish the distinction between iridophores and leucophores is not always obvious , but , in general , iridophores are considered to generate iridescent or metallic colours , whereas leucophores produce reflective white hues this was subsequently identified as pterorhodin , a pteridine dimer that accumulates around eumelanin core , and it is also present in a variety of tree frog species from australia and papua new guinea humans have only one class of pigment cell , the mammalian equivalent of melanophores , to generate skin , hair , and eye colour for this reason , and because the large number and contrasting colour of the cells usually make them very easy to visualise , melanophores are by far the most widely studied chromatophore many species are able to translocate the pigment inside their chromatophores , resulting in an apparent change in body colour this process , known as physiological colour change , is most widely studied in melanophores , since melanin is the darkest and most visible pigment flat dermal melanophores often overlay other chromatophores , so when the pigment is dispersed throughout the cell the skin appears dark it has been demonstrated that the process can be under hormone or neuronal control or both and for many species of bony fishes it is known that chromatophores can respond directly to environmental stimuli like visible light , uv-radiation , temperature , ph , chemicals , etc numerous melanocortin , mch and melatonin receptors have been identified in fish and frogs , including a homologue of mc1r , a melanocortin receptor known to regulate skin and hair colour in humans during vertebrate embryonic development , chromatophores are one of a number of cell types generated in the neural crest , a paired strip of cells arising at the margins of the neural tube coleoid cephalopods ( including octopuses , squids and cuttlefish ) have complex multicellular organs that they use to change colour rapidly , producing a wide variety of bright colours and patterns

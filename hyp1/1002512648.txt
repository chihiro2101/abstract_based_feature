an important part of some arguments for functionalism is the idea of multiple realizability according to standard functionalist theories , mental states correspond to functional roles they are like valves ; a valve can be made of plastic or metal or other materials , as long as it performs the proper function ( controlling the flow of a liquid or gas ) similarly , functionalists argue , mental states can be explained without considering the states of the underlying physical medium ( such as the brain ) that realizes them ; one need only consider higher-level functions because mental states are not limited to a particular medium , they can be realized in multiple ways , including , theoretically , within non-biological systems , such as computers a silicon-based machine could have the same sort of mental life that a human being has , provided that its structure realized the proper functional roles however , there have been some functionalist theories that combine with the identity theory of mind , which deny multiple realizability such functional specification theories ( fsts ) ( levin , § 3.4 ) , as they are called , were most notably developed by david lewis lewis , david according to fsts , mental states are the particular '' realizers '' of the functional role , not the functional role itself the mental state of belief , for example , just is whatever brain or neurological process that realizes the appropriate belief function thus , unlike standard versions of functionalism ( often called functional state identity theories ) , fsts do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states , because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential what often drives this view is the belief that if we were to encounter an alien race with a cognitive system composed of significantly different material from humans ' ( e.g , silicon-based ) but performed the same functions as human mental states ( for example , they tend to yell '' ouch ! '' when poked with sharp objects ) , we would say that their type of mental state might be similar to ours but it is the same ( later published as '' the nature of mental states '' in putnam ( 1975a ) arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do , and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind the first formulation of a functionalist theory of mind was put forth by hilary putnam in the 1960s in non-technical terms , a turing machine is not a physical object , but rather an abstract machine built upon a mathematical model typically , a turing machine has a horizontal tape divided into rectangular cells arranged from left to right the machine has a read-write head that scans cells and moves in left and right directions because of the infinite tape , a traditional turing machine has an infinite amount of time to compute any particular function or any number of functions if it is in state one and reads a 1 , it will move one square to the right and also go into state two if it is in state three and reads a b , it prints a 1 and remains in state three finally , if it is in state three and reads a 1 , then it will stay in state three state one , for example , is simply the state in which the machine , if it reads a b , writes a 1 and stays in that state , and in which , if it reads a 1 , it moves one square to the right and goes into a different state this is the functional definition of state one ; it is its causal role in the overall system according to machine-state functionalism , the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the turing machine states described above “ the mental life of some machines , ” in h.-n detroit , mi : wayne state university press , pp therefore , it is not a particular physical-chemical composition responsible for the particular machine or mental state , it is the programming rules which produce the effects that are responsible psychofunctionalists view psychology as employing the same sorts of irreducibly teleology or purposive explanations as the biological sciences in an analogous manner , the role of mental states , such as belief and desire , is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best scientific psychological theory on the other hand , if it turns out that there are states which theoretical cognitive psychology posits as necessary for explanation of human behavior but which are not foreseen by ordinary folk psychological language , then these entities or states exist a third form of functionalism is concerned with the meanings of theoretical terms in general such terms are subject to conceptual analyses which take something like the following form : : mental state m is the state that is preconceived by p and causes q these sorts of functional definitions in terms of causal roles are claimed to be analytic and a priori truths about the submental states and the ( largely fictitious ) propositional attitudes they describe chinese nation ) and john searle 's chinese room thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism ( see below under '' criticism '' ) but this would seem to put into serious doubt , if not directly contradict , the fundamental idea of the supervenience thesis : there can be no change in the mental realm without some change in the underlying physical substratum given the transitivity of supervenience , if m1 supervenes on m2 , and m2 supervenes on p ( physical base ) , then m1 and m2 both supervene on p , even though they are ( allegedly ) totally different sets of mental facts the homunculi at each level , on this view , have authentic mental properties but become simpler and less intelligent as one works one 's way down the hierarchy “ a mechanist manifesto for the philosophy of mind : the third way for functionalists ” a mechanistic explanation involves decomposing a given system , in this case a mental system , into its component physical parts , their activities or functions , and their combined organizational relations this account remains a sort of functionalism because functional relations are still essential to mental states , but it is mechanistic because the functional relations are always manifestations of concrete structures—albeit structures understood at a certain level of abstraction functions are individuated and explained either in terms of the contributions they make to the given system or in teleological terms by providing an applicable framework for merging traditional psychological models with neurological data , mechanistic functionalism may be understood as reconciling the functionalist theory of mind with neurological accounts of how the brain actually works this is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states ( mental states ) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms on the other hand , most philosophers of mind who are functionalists claim to be physicalists—indeed , some of them , such as david lewis , have claimed to be strict reductionist-type physicalists on this understanding , type physicalism can be seen as incompatible with functionalism , since it claims that what characterizes mental states ( e.g pain ) is that they are physical in nature , while functionalism says that what characterizes pain is its functional/causal role and its relationship with yelling '' ouch '' , etc moreover , most functionalists who are physicalists require that the properties that are quantified over in functional definitions be physical properties the chinese room argument by john searle is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions that even though mental content can not be fully accounted for in functional terms , there is nevertheless a nomological correlation between mental states and functional states in this world however , since the system will be in unique states at each moment and at each possible input , such a mapping will always exist so there will be a transducer layer which will produce whatever physical behavior is desired '' passionate engines - what emotions reveal about the mind and artificial intelligence

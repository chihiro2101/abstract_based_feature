an important part of some arguments for functionalism is the idea of multiple realizability according to standard functionalist theories , mental states correspond to functional roles they are like valves ; a valve can be made of plastic or metal or other materials , as long as it performs the proper function ( controlling the flow of a liquid or gas ) similarly , functionalists argue , mental states can be explained without considering the states of the underlying physical medium ( such as the brain ) that realizes them ; one need only consider higher-level functions because mental states are not limited to a particular medium , they can be realized in multiple ways , including , theoretically , within non-biological systems , such as computers a silicon-based machine could have the same sort of mental life that a human being has , provided that its structure realized the proper functional roles however , there have been some functionalist theories that combine with the identity theory of mind , which deny multiple realizability such functional specification theories ( fsts ) ( levin , § 3.4 ) , as they are called , were most notably developed by david lewis lewis , david the mental state of belief , for example , just is whatever brain or neurological process that realizes the appropriate belief function thus , unlike standard versions of functionalism ( often called functional state identity theories ) , fsts do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states , because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential what often drives this view is the belief that if we were to encounter an alien race with a cognitive system composed of significantly different material from humans ' ( e.g , silicon-based ) but performed the same functions as human mental states ( for example , they tend to yell '' ouch ! '' when poked with sharp objects ) , we would say that their type of mental state might be similar to ours but it is the same ( later published as '' the nature of mental states '' in putnam ( 1975a ) in non-technical terms , a turing machine is not a physical object , but rather an abstract machine built upon a mathematical model typically , a turing machine has a horizontal tape divided into rectangular cells arranged from left to right the tape itself is infinite in length , and each cell may contain a symbol the machine has a read-write head that scans cells and moves in left and right directions the essential point to consider here is the nature of the states of the turing machine each state can be defined exclusively in terms of its relations to the other states as well as inputs and outputs this is the functional definition of state one ; it is its causal role in the overall system detroit , mi : wayne state university press , p because biological organisms “ go through a succession of states in time ” , any such organisms could also be equivalent to turing machines according to machine-state functionalism , the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the turing machine states described above this view is most closely associated with jerry fodor and zenon pylyshyn and has been labeled psycho-functionalism the fundamental idea of psycho-functionalism is that psychology is an irreducibly complex science and that the terms that we use to describe the entities and properties of the mind in our best psychological theories can not be redefined in terms of simple behavioral dispositions , and further , that such a redefinition would not be desirable or salient were it achievable thus , for example , the function or role of the heart is to pump blood , that of the kidney is to filter it and to maintain certain chemical balances and so on—this is what accounts for the purposes of scientific explanation and taxonomy in an analogous manner , the role of mental states , such as belief and desire , is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best scientific psychological theory hysteria ) is determined not to have any fundamental role in cognitive psychological explanation , then that particular state may be considered not to exist a third form of functionalism is concerned with the meanings of theoretical terms in general the basic idea of analytic functionalism is that theoretical terms are implicitly defined by the theories in whose formulation they occur and not by intrinsic properties of the phonemes they comprise for example , the state of pain is caused by sitting on a tack and causes loud cries , and higher order mental states of anger and resentment directed at the careless person who left a tack lying around homuncular functionalism was developed largely by daniel dennett and has been advocated by william lycan chinese nation ) and john searle 's chinese room thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism ( see below under '' criticism '' ) this can be easily seen if we label the set of mental facts that occur at the higher-level m1 and the set of mental facts that occur at the lower-level m2 ) functions : selection and mechanisms that is , instead of mental states receiving a purely functional explanation in terms of their relations to other mental states , like those listed above , functions are seen as playing only a part—the other part being played by structures— of the explanation of a given mental state a mechanistic explanation involves decomposing a given system , in this case a mental system , into its component physical parts , their activities or functions , and their combined organizational relations this is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states ( mental states ) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms it has often been claimed that functionalism somehow '' disproves '' or falsifies physicalism tout court ( i.e without further explanation or description ) on the other hand , most philosophers of mind who are functionalists claim to be physicalists—indeed , some of them , such as david lewis , have claimed to be strict reductionist-type physicalists functionalism is fundamentally what ned block has called a broadly metaphysical thesis as opposed to a narrowly ontological one that is , functionalism is not so much concerned with what there is than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state , e.g on this understanding , type physicalism can be seen as incompatible with functionalism , since it claims that what characterizes mental states ( e.g pain ) is that they are physical in nature , while functionalism says that what characterizes pain is its functional/causal role and its relationship with yelling '' ouch '' , etc moreover , most functionalists who are physicalists require that the properties that are quantified over in functional definitions be physical properties in the case of david lewis , there is a distinction in the concepts of '' having pain '' ( a rigid designator true of the same things in all possible worlds ) and just '' pain '' ( a non-rigid designator ) pain , for lewis , stands for something like the definite description '' the state with the causal role x '' the chinese room argument by john searle is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions in short , searle describes a person who only speaks english who is in a room with only chinese symbols in baskets and a rule book in english for moving the symbols around ( functionalism says that mental states are produced by the functional relations in the brain therefore , so the argument goes , since two people can be functionally identical , yet have different mental states , functionalism can not sufficiently account for all mental states given that the states of a physical system are always at least slightly unique , such a mapping will always exist , so any system is a mind

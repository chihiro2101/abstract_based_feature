an important part of some arguments for functionalism is the idea of multiple realizability according to standard functionalist theories , mental states correspond to functional roles they are like valves ; a valve can be made of plastic or metal or other materials , as long as it performs the proper function ( controlling the flow of a liquid or gas ) similarly , functionalists argue , mental states can be explained without considering the states of the underlying physical medium ( such as the brain ) that realizes them ; one need only consider higher-level functions because mental states are not limited to a particular medium , they can be realized in multiple ways , including , theoretically , within non-biological systems , such as computers a silicon-based machine could have the same sort of mental life that a human being has , provided that its structure realized the proper functional roles such functional specification theories ( fsts ) ( levin , § 3.4 ) , as they are called , were most notably developed by david lewis lewis , david according to fsts , mental states are the particular '' realizers '' of the functional role , not the functional role itself the mental state of belief , for example , just is whatever brain or neurological process that realizes the appropriate belief function thus , unlike standard versions of functionalism ( often called functional state identity theories ) , fsts do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states , because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential what often drives this view is the belief that if we were to encounter an alien race with a cognitive system composed of significantly different material from humans ' ( e.g , silicon-based ) but performed the same functions as human mental states ( for example , they tend to yell '' ouch ! '' when poked with sharp objects ) , we would say that their type of mental state might be similar to ours but it is the same ( later published as '' the nature of mental states '' in putnam ( 1975a ) arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do , and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind the broad position of '' functionalism '' can be articulated in many different varieties this formulation , which is now called machine-state functionalism , or just machine functionalism , was inspired by the analogies which putnam and others noted between the mind and the theoretical '' machines '' or computers capable of computing any given algorithm which were developed by alan turing ( called turing machines ) the beginning of his opposition to machine-state functionalism can be read about in his twin earth thought experiment typically , a turing machine has a horizontal tape divided into rectangular cells arranged from left to right if it is in state one and reads a 1 , it will move one square to the right and also go into state two if it is in state two and reads a b , it will print a 1 and stay in state two if it is in state three and reads a b , it prints a 1 and remains in state three each state can be defined exclusively in terms of its relations to the other states as well as inputs and outputs state one , for example , is simply the state in which the machine , if it reads a b , writes a 1 and stays in that state , and in which , if it reads a 1 , it moves one square to the right and goes into a different state according to machine-state functionalism , the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the turing machine states described above therefore , it is not a particular physical-chemical composition responsible for the particular machine or mental state , it is the programming rules which produce the effects that are responsible a second form of functionalism is based on the rejection of behaviorism theories in psychology and their replacement with empirical cognitive models of the mind psychofunctionalists view psychology as employing the same sorts of irreducibly teleology or purposive explanations as the biological sciences in an analogous manner , the role of mental states , such as belief and desire , is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best scientific psychological theory if some mental state which is postulated by folk psychology ( e.g hysteria ) is determined not to have any fundamental role in cognitive psychological explanation , then that particular state may be considered not to exist a third form of functionalism is concerned with the meanings of theoretical terms in general the basic idea of analytic functionalism is that theoretical terms are implicitly defined by the theories in whose formulation they occur and not by intrinsic properties of the phonemes they comprise such terms are subject to conceptual analyses which take something like the following form : : mental state m is the state that is preconceived by p and causes q these sorts of functional definitions in terms of causal roles are claimed to be analytic and a priori truths about the submental states and the ( largely fictitious ) propositional attitudes they describe given the transitivity of supervenience , if m1 supervenes on m2 , and m2 supervenes on p ( physical base ) , then m1 and m2 both supervene on p , even though they are ( allegedly ) totally different sets of mental facts that is , instead of mental states receiving a purely functional explanation in terms of their relations to other mental states , like those listed above , functions are seen as playing only a part—the other part being played by structures— of the explanation of a given mental state a mechanistic explanation involves decomposing a given system , in this case a mental system , into its component physical parts , their activities or functions , and their combined organizational relations on this account the mind remains a functional system , but one that is understood in mechanistic terms functions are individuated and explained either in terms of the contributions they make to the given system or in teleological terms if the functions are understood in teleological terms , then they may be characterized either etiologically or non-etiologically this is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states ( mental states ) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms it has often been claimed that functionalism somehow '' disproves '' or falsifies physicalism tout court ( i.e on the other hand , most philosophers of mind who are functionalists claim to be physicalists—indeed , some of them , such as david lewis , have claimed to be strict reductionist-type physicalists that is , functionalism is not so much concerned with what there is than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state , e.g on this understanding , type physicalism can be seen as incompatible with functionalism , since it claims that what characterizes mental states ( e.g in the case of david lewis , there is a distinction in the concepts of '' having pain '' ( a rigid designator true of the same things in all possible worlds ) and just '' pain '' ( a non-rigid designator ) pain , for lewis , stands for something like the definite description '' the state with the causal role x '' for lewis , therefore , local type-physical reductions are possible and compatible with conceptual functionalism further suppose that the people outside of the room are chinese speakers and are communicating with the person inside via the chinese symbols thus , it begs the question of functional mental states : its assumption denies the possibility of functionalism itself , without offering any independent justification for doing so ( functionalism says that mental states are produced by the functional relations in the brain such a position is represented , for example , by jerry fodor 's account of an '' asymmetric causal theory '' of mental content however , since the system will be in unique states at each moment and at each possible input , such a mapping will always exist so there will be a transducer layer which will produce whatever physical behavior is desired

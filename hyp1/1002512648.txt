an important part of some arguments for functionalism is the idea of multiple realizability according to standard functionalist theories , mental states correspond to functional roles similarly , functionalists argue , mental states can be explained without considering the states of the underlying physical medium ( such as the brain ) that realizes them ; one need only consider higher-level functions because mental states are not limited to a particular medium , they can be realized in multiple ways , including , theoretically , within non-biological systems , such as computers a silicon-based machine could have the same sort of mental life that a human being has , provided that its structure realized the proper functional roles however , there have been some functionalist theories that combine with the identity theory of mind , which deny multiple realizability such functional specification theories ( fsts ) ( levin , § 3.4 ) , as they are called , were most notably developed by david lewis lewis , david according to fsts , mental states are the particular '' realizers '' of the functional role , not the functional role itself the mental state of belief , for example , just is whatever brain or neurological process that realizes the appropriate belief function what often drives this view is the belief that if we were to encounter an alien race with a cognitive system composed of significantly different material from humans ' ( e.g , silicon-based ) but performed the same functions as human mental states ( for example , they tend to yell '' ouch ! '' when poked with sharp objects ) , we would say that their type of mental state might be similar to ours but it is the same arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do , and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind the first formulation of a functionalist theory of mind was put forth by hilary putnam in the 1960s this formulation , which is now called machine-state functionalism , or just machine functionalism , was inspired by the analogies which putnam and others noted between the mind and the theoretical '' machines '' or computers capable of computing any given algorithm which were developed by alan turing ( called turing machines ) the beginning of his opposition to machine-state functionalism can be read about in his twin earth thought experiment because of the infinite tape , a traditional turing machine has an infinite amount of time to compute any particular function or any number of functions the possible outputs are : halt : do nothing if it is in state one and reads a 1 , it will move one square to the right and also go into state two if it is in state two and reads a 1 , it will move one square to the right and go into state three state one , for example , is simply the state in which the machine , if it reads a b , writes a 1 and stays in that state , and in which , if it reads a 1 , it moves one square to the right and goes into a different state since turing machines are not required to be physical systems , '' anything capable of going through a succession of states in time can be a turing machine '' detroit , mi : wayne state university press , p according to machine-state functionalism , the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the turing machine states described above “ the mental life of some machines , ” in h.-n this view is most closely associated with jerry fodor and zenon pylyshyn and has been labeled psycho-functionalism the fundamental idea of psycho-functionalism is that psychology is an irreducibly complex science and that the terms that we use to describe the entities and properties of the mind in our best psychological theories can not be redefined in terms of simple behavioral dispositions , and further , that such a redefinition would not be desirable or salient were it achievable psychofunctionalists view psychology as employing the same sorts of irreducibly teleology or purposive explanations as the biological sciences thus , for example , the function or role of the heart is to pump blood , that of the kidney is to filter it and to maintain certain chemical balances and so on—this is what accounts for the purposes of scientific explanation and taxonomy in an analogous manner , the role of mental states , such as belief and desire , is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best scientific psychological theory hysteria ) is determined not to have any fundamental role in cognitive psychological explanation , then that particular state may be considered not to exist the basic idea of analytic functionalism is that theoretical terms are implicitly defined by the theories in whose formulation they occur and not by intrinsic properties of the phonemes they comprise such terms are subject to conceptual analyses which take something like the following form : : mental state m is the state that is preconceived by p and causes q chinese nation ) and john searle 's chinese room thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism ( see below under '' criticism '' ) but this would seem to put into serious doubt , if not directly contradict , the fundamental idea of the supervenience thesis : there can be no change in the mental realm without some change in the underlying physical substratum the homunculi at each level , on this view , have authentic mental properties but become simpler and less intelligent as one works one 's way down the hierarchy mechanistic functionalism , originally formulated and defended by gualtiero piccinini and carl gillett gillett , c independently , augments previous functionalist accounts of mental states by maintaining that any psychological explanation must be rendered in mechanistic terms a mechanistic explanation involves decomposing a given system , in this case a mental system , into its component physical parts , their activities or functions , and their combined organizational relations on this account the mind remains a functional system , but one that is understood in mechanistic terms this account remains a sort of functionalism because functional relations are still essential to mental states , but it is mechanistic because the functional relations are always manifestations of concrete structures—albeit structures understood at a certain level of abstraction functions are individuated and explained either in terms of the contributions they make to the given system or in teleological terms this is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states ( mental states ) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms there is much confusion about the sort of relationship that is claimed to exist ( or not exist ) between the general thesis of functionalism and physicalism it has often been claimed that functionalism somehow '' disproves '' or falsifies physicalism tout court ( i.e however , any weaker sort of physicalism which makes the simple ontological claim that everything that exists is made up of physical matter is perfectly compatible with functionalism the referent of the description in humans is a type of brain state to be determined by science the referent among silicon-based life forms is something else for lewis , therefore , local type-physical reductions are possible and compatible with conceptual functionalism another main criticism of functionalism is the inverted spectrum or inverted qualia scenario , most specifically proposed as an objection to functionalism by ned block ( functionalism says that mental states are produced by the functional relations in the brain as an example , he proposes that the economy of bolivia might be organized such that the economic states , inputs , and outputs would be isomorphic to a person under some bizarre mapping from mental to economic variables the assumption is that adding a transducer layer , that is , an input-output system , to an object should not change whether that object has mental states ( later published as '' the nature of mental states '' in putnam ( 1975a )

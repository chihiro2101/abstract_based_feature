an important part of some arguments for functionalism is the idea of multiple realizability according to standard functionalist theories , mental states correspond to functional roles similarly , functionalists argue , mental states can be explained without considering the states of the underlying physical medium ( such as the brain ) that realizes them ; one need only consider higher-level functions because mental states are not limited to a particular medium , they can be realized in multiple ways , including , theoretically , within non-biological systems , such as computers a silicon-based machine could have the same sort of mental life that a human being has , provided that its structure realized the proper functional roles however , there have been some functionalist theories that combine with the identity theory of mind , which deny multiple realizability such functional specification theories ( fsts ) ( levin , § 3.4 ) , as they are called , were most notably developed by david lewis lewis , david according to fsts , mental states are the particular '' realizers '' of the functional role , not the functional role itself the mental state of belief , for example , just is whatever brain or neurological process that realizes the appropriate belief function thus , unlike standard versions of functionalism ( often called functional state identity theories ) , fsts do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states , because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential , silicon-based ) but performed the same functions as human mental states ( for example , they tend to yell '' ouch ! '' when poked with sharp objects ) , we would say that their type of mental state might be similar to ours but it is the same indeed , one of hilary putnam 's putnam , hilary arguments for his version of functionalism relied on the intuition that such alien creatures would have the same mental states as humans do , and that the multiple realizability of standard functionalism makes it a better theory of mind image : maquina.png thumb right artistic representation of a turing machine this formulation , which is now called machine-state functionalism , or just machine functionalism , was inspired by the analogies which putnam and others noted between the mind and the theoretical '' machines '' or computers capable of computing any given algorithm which were developed by alan turing ( called turing machines ) typically , a turing machine has a horizontal tape divided into rectangular cells arranged from left to right the action of the machine is determined by the symbol in the cell being scanned and a table of transition rules that serve as the machine 's programming because of the infinite tape , a traditional turing machine has an infinite amount of time to compute any particular function or any number of functions an extremely simple example of a turing machine which writes out the sequence '111 ' after scanning three blank squares and then stops as specified by the following machine table : this table states that if the machine is in state one and scans a blank square ( b ) , it will print a 1 and remain in state one if it is in state one and reads a 1 , it will move one square to the right and also go into state two if it is in state two and reads a b , it will print a 1 and stay in state two each state can be defined exclusively in terms of its relations to the other states as well as inputs and outputs since turing machines are not required to be physical systems , '' anything capable of going through a succession of states in time can be a turing machine '' because biological organisms “ go through a succession of states in time ” , any such organisms could also be equivalent to turing machines according to machine-state functionalism , the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the turing machine states described above “ the mental life of some machines , ” in h.-n detroit , mi : wayne state university press , pp therefore , it is not a particular physical-chemical composition responsible for the particular machine or mental state , it is the programming rules which produce the effects that are responsible a second form of functionalism is based on the rejection of behaviorism theories in psychology and their replacement with empirical cognitive models of the mind in an analogous manner , the role of mental states , such as belief and desire , is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best scientific psychological theory this view is most closely associated with david lewis and is often referred to as analytic functionalism or conceptual functionalism the basic idea of analytic functionalism is that theoretical terms are implicitly defined by the theories in whose formulation they occur and not by intrinsic properties of the phonemes they comprise these sorts of functional definitions in terms of causal roles are claimed to be analytic and a priori truths about the submental states and the ( largely fictitious ) propositional attitudes they describe chinese nation ) and john searle 's chinese room thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism ( see below under '' criticism '' ) it would become a sort of systemic or collective mind with propositional attitudes and other mental characteristics this can be easily seen if we label the set of mental facts that occur at the higher-level m1 and the set of mental facts that occur at the lower-level m2 given the transitivity of supervenience , if m1 supervenes on m2 , and m2 supervenes on p ( physical base ) , then m1 and m2 both supervene on p , even though they are ( allegedly ) totally different sets of mental facts the homunculi at each level , on this view , have authentic mental properties but become simpler and less intelligent as one works one 's way down the hierarchy “ understanding the sciences through the fog of ‘ functionalism ( s ) ’ ” on this account the mind remains a functional system , but one that is understood in mechanistic terms this account remains a sort of functionalism because functional relations are still essential to mental states , but it is mechanistic because the functional relations are always manifestations of concrete structures—albeit structures understood at a certain level of abstraction by providing an applicable framework for merging traditional psychological models with neurological data , mechanistic functionalism may be understood as reconciling the functionalist theory of mind with neurological accounts of how the brain actually works this is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states ( mental states ) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms it has often been claimed that functionalism somehow '' disproves '' or falsifies physicalism tout court ( i.e on the other hand , most philosophers of mind who are functionalists claim to be physicalists—indeed , some of them , such as david lewis , have claimed to be strict reductionist-type physicalists that is , functionalism is not so much concerned with what there is than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state , e.g moreover , most functionalists who are physicalists require that the properties that are quantified over in functional definitions be physical properties the referent among silicon-based life forms is something else ned block block , ned the chinese room argument by john searle is a direct attack on the claim that thought can be represented as a set of functions in other words , since you share the same inputs , outputs , and relations between other mental states , you are functional duplicates given that the states of a physical system are always at least slightly unique , such a mapping will always exist , so any system is a mind '' functionalism '' , the stanford

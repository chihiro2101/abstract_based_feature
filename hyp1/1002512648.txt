an important part of some arguments for functionalism is the idea of multiple realizability according to standard functionalist theories , mental states correspond to functional roles they are like valves ; a valve can be made of plastic or metal or other materials , as long as it performs the proper function ( controlling the flow of a liquid or gas ) similarly , functionalists argue , mental states can be explained without considering the states of the underlying physical medium ( such as the brain ) that realizes them ; one need only consider higher-level functions because mental states are not limited to a particular medium , they can be realized in multiple ways , including , theoretically , within non-biological systems , such as computers a silicon-based machine could have the same sort of mental life that a human being has , provided that its structure realized the proper functional roles however , there have been some functionalist theories that combine with the identity theory of mind , which deny multiple realizability such functional specification theories ( fsts ) ( levin , § 3.4 ) , as they are called , were most notably developed by david lewis lewis , david a materialistic theory of the mind according to fsts , mental states are the particular '' realizers '' of the functional role , not the functional role itself the mental state of belief , for example , just is whatever brain or neurological process that realizes the appropriate belief function thus , unlike standard versions of functionalism ( often called functional state identity theories ) , fsts do not allow for the multiple realizability of mental states , because the fact that mental states are realized by brain states is essential what often drives this view is the belief that if we were to encounter an alien race with a cognitive system composed of significantly different material from humans ' ( e.g the first formulation of a functionalist theory of mind was put forth by hilary putnam in the 1960s in non-technical terms , a turing machine is not a physical object , but rather an abstract machine built upon a mathematical model finally , if it is in state three and reads a 1 , then it will stay in state three the essential point to consider here is the nature of the states of the turing machine each state can be defined exclusively in terms of its relations to the other states as well as inputs and outputs the details of how it accomplishes what it accomplishes and of its material constitution are completely irrelevant since turing machines are not required to be physical systems , '' anything capable of going through a succession of states in time can be a turing machine '' according to machine-state functionalism , the nature of a mental state is just like the nature of the turing machine states described above if one can show the rational functioning and computing skills of these machines to be comparable to the rational functioning and computing skills of human beings , it follows that turing machine behavior closely resembles that of human beings a second form of functionalism is based on the rejection of behaviorism theories in psychology and their replacement with empirical cognitive models of the mind psychofunctionalists view psychology as employing the same sorts of irreducibly teleology or purposive explanations as the biological sciences there may be an infinite variety of physical realizations for all of the mechanisms , but what is important is only their role in the overall biological theory in an analogous manner , the role of mental states , such as belief and desire , is determined by the functional or causal role that is designated for them within our best scientific psychological theory hysteria ) is determined not to have any fundamental role in cognitive psychological explanation , then that particular state may be considered not to exist on the other hand , if it turns out that there are states which theoretical cognitive psychology posits as necessary for explanation of human behavior but which are not foreseen by ordinary folk psychological language , then these entities or states exist a third form of functionalism is concerned with the meanings of theoretical terms in general this view is most closely associated with david lewis and is often referred to as analytic functionalism or conceptual functionalism these sorts of functional definitions in terms of causal roles are claimed to be analytic and a priori truths about the submental states and the ( largely fictitious ) propositional attitudes they describe the essential difference between analytic and psychofunctionalism is that the latter emphasizes the importance of laboratory observation and experimentation in the determination of which mental state terms and concepts are genuine and which functional identifications may be considered to be genuinely contingent and a posteriori identities the former , on the other hand , claims that such identities are necessary and not subject to empirical scientific investigation chinese nation ) and john searle 's chinese room thought experiments presented for the more traditional forms of functionalism ( see below under '' criticism '' ) this can be easily seen if we label the set of mental facts that occur at the higher-level m1 and the set of mental facts that occur at the lower-level m2 given the transitivity of supervenience , if m1 supervenes on m2 , and m2 supervenes on p ( physical base ) , then m1 and m2 both supervene on p , even though they are ( allegedly ) totally different sets of mental facts “ a mechanist manifesto for the philosophy of mind : the third way for functionalists ” independently , augments previous functionalist accounts of mental states by maintaining that any psychological explanation must be rendered in mechanistic terms a mechanistic explanation involves decomposing a given system , in this case a mental system , into its component physical parts , their activities or functions , and their combined organizational relations on this account the mind remains a functional system , but one that is understood in mechanistic terms functions are individuated and explained either in terms of the contributions they make to the given system or in teleological terms mechanistic functionalism leads functionalism away from the traditional functionalist autonomy of psychology from neuroscience and towards integrating psychology and neuroscience this is due to the fact that mechanistic explanations of function attempt to provide an account of how functional states ( mental states ) are physically realized through neurological mechanisms that is , functionalism is not so much concerned with what there is than with what it is that characterizes a certain type of mental state , e.g pain , as the type of state that it is on this understanding , type physicalism can be seen as incompatible with functionalism , since it claims that what characterizes mental states ( e.g pain ) is that they are physical in nature , while functionalism says that what characterizes pain is its functional/causal role and its relationship with yelling '' ouch '' , etc in the case of david lewis , there is a distinction in the concepts of '' having pain '' ( a rigid designator true of the same things in all possible worlds ) and just '' pain '' ( a non-rigid designator ) pain , for lewis , stands for something like the definite description '' the state with the causal role x '' argues against the functionalist proposal of multiple realizability , where hardware implementation is irrelevant because only the functional level is important jane will , for example , properly obey traffic signs just as any other person would , even though this involves the color perception in other words , since you share the same inputs , outputs , and relations between other mental states , you are functional duplicates given that the states of a physical system are always at least slightly unique , such a mapping will always exist , so any system is a mind

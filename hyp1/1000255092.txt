the word infrastructure has been used in french since 1875 and in english since 1887 , originally meaning '' the installations that form the basis for any operation or system '' the word is a combination of the latin prefix '' infra '' , meaning '' below '' , as many of these constructions are underground ( for example , tunnels , water and gas systems , and railways ) , and the french word '' structure '' ( derived from the latin word '' structure '' ) the army use of the term achieved currency in the united states after the formation of nato in the 1940s , and by 1970 was adopted by urban planning in its modern civilian sense this article will explore many aspects of infrastructure , including classification , applications , related concepts , ownership and financing , the developing world , and its sustainable future & nbsp ; both specific functional modes – highways , streets , roads , and bridges ; mass transit ; airports and airways ; water supply and water resources ; wastewater management ; solid-waste treatment and disposal ; electric power generation and transmission ; telecommunications ; and hazardous waste – and the combined system these modal elements comprise the american society of civil engineers publishes a '' infrastructure report card '' which represents the organizations opinion on the condition of various infrastructure every 2–4 years green infrastructure is a type of sustainable infrastructure green infrastructure uses plant or soil systems to restore some of the natural processes needed to manage water and create healthier urban environments in a more practical sense , it refers to a decentralized network of stormwater management practices , which includes green roofs , trees , bioretention and infiltration , and permeable pavement green infrastructure has become an increasingly popular strategy in recent years due to its effectiveness in providing ecological , economic , and social benefits -- including positively impacting energy consumption , air quality , and carbon reduction and sequestration one benefit of green roofs is that they reduce stormwater runoff because of its ability to store water in its growing media , reducing the runoff entering the sewer system and waterways , which also decreases the risk of combined sewer overflows trees also reduce energy usage by providing shade and releasing water into the atmosphere which cools the air and reduces the amount of heat absorbed by buildings some individuals have referred to this planned settlement as “ utopia-like ” , due to the fact that it will feature multiple sustainable infrastructure elements , including energy , water , waste management , and transportation airport infrastructure asset management plan green infrastructure infrastructure as a service infrastructure asset management infrastructure security logistics megaproject project finance pseudo-urbanization public capital sustainable architecture sustainable engineering body of knowledge on infrastructure regulation next generation infrastructures international research programme report card on america 's infrastructure

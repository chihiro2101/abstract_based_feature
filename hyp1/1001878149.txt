the starting point is weathering of freshly accumulated parent material primitive microbes feed on simple compounds ( nutrients ) released by weathering , and produce acids which contribute to weathering new soils increase in depth by a combination of weathering , and further deposition soils deepen with accumulation of humus primarily due to the activities of higher plants as soils mature , they develop layers as organic matter accumulates and leaching takes place factors of soil formation soil formation is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil when reordered to climate , relief , organisms , parent material , and time , they form the acronym cropt the mineral material from which a soil forms is called parent material rock , whether its origin is igneous , sedimentary , or metamorphic , is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen , hydrogen and carbon as the parent material is chemically and physically weathered , transported , deposited and precipitated , it is transformed into a soil residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary bedrock cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place residual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks alluvium are those moved and deposited by flowing water ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral moraines in the case of stationary glaciers retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases , outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier cumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material this includes peat and muck soils and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table the weathering of parent material takes the form of physical weathering ( disintegration ) , chemical weathering ( decomposition ) and chemical transformation weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material , because physical , chemical , and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth chemical weathering mainly results from the excretion of organic acids and chelating compounds by bacteria and fungi , thought to increase under present-day greenhouse effect physical disintegration is the first stage in the transformation of parent material into soil finally , organisms reduce parent material in size and create crevices and pores through the mechanical action of plant roots and the digging activity of animals hydrolysis is the transformation of minerals into polar molecules by the splitting of intervening water chemical weathering becomes more effective as the surface area of the rock increases , thus is favoured by physical disintegration this stems in latitudinal and altitudinal climate gradients in regolith formation the principal climatic variables influencing soil formation are effective precipitation ( i.e if warm temperatures and abundant water are present in the profile at the same time , the processes of weathering , leaching , and plant growth will be maximized to be effective in soil formation , water must penetrate the regolith the greater the depth of water penetration , the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development it may also carry away soluble materials in the surface drainage waters for all of these reasons , steep slopes prevent the formation of soil from getting very far ahead of soil destruction therefore , soils on steep terrain tend to have rather shallow , poorly developed profiles in comparison to soils on nearby , more level sites soils at the bottom of a hill will get more water than soils on the slopes , and soils on the slopes that face the sun path will be drier than soils on slopes that do not in swales and depressions where runoff water tends to concentrate , the regolith is usually more deeply weathered and soil profile development is more advanced these same differences are important to understanding natural history and when managing the land resource plants can form new chemicals that can break down minerals , both directly and indirectly through mycorrhizal fungi and rhizosphere bacteria , and improve the soil structure soil factors such as density , depth , chemistry , ph , temperature and moisture greatly affect the type of plants that can grow in a given location over time the soil will develop a profile that depends on the intensities of biota and climate soil mixing ( pedoturbation ) is often an important factor in soil formation eluvium is the translocation of colloid material , such as organic matter , clay and other mineral compounds key soil forming processes especially important to macro-scale patterns of soil formation are : laterite podsolization calcification salinization gleysol

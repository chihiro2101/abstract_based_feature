primitive microbes feed on simple compounds ( nutrients ) released by weathering , and produce acids which contribute to weathering an estimated soil production function fits observations rates new soils can also deepen from dust deposition gradually soil is able to support higher forms of plants and animals , starting with pioneer species , and proceeding to more complex soil food web soils deepen with accumulation of humus primarily due to the activities of higher plants factors of soil formation soil formation is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil they are : parent material , climate , topography ( relief ) , organisms , and time when reordered to climate , relief , organisms , parent material , and time , they form the acronym cropt the mineral material from which a soil forms is called parent material rock , whether its origin is igneous , sedimentary , or metamorphic , is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen , hydrogen and carbon as the parent material is chemically and physically weathered , transported , deposited and precipitated , it is transformed into a soil cumulose material is organic matter that has grown and accumulates in place ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral moraines in the case of stationary glaciers parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as scree and is called colluvial material cumulose parent material is not moved but originates from deposited organic material this includes peat and muck soils and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table the weathering of parent material takes the form of physical weathering ( disintegration ) , chemical weathering ( decomposition ) and chemical transformation weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material , because physical , chemical , and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth chemical weathering mainly results from the excretion of organic acids and chelating compounds by bacteria and fungi , thought to increase under present-day greenhouse effect physical disintegration is the first stage in the transformation of parent material into soil temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock , splitting it along lines of weakness cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size , as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind , water , and gravity water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying , thereby stressing the rock grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation hydrolysis is the transformation of minerals into polar molecules by the splitting of intervening water for example , the hydrolysis of orthoclase-feldspar transforms it to acid silicate clay and basic potassium hydroxide , both of which are more soluble redox , the opposite of oxidation , means the removal of oxygen , hence the oxidation number of some part of the mineral is reduced , which occurs when oxygen is scarce of the above , hydrolysis and carbonation are the most effective , in particular in regions of high rainfall , temperature and physical erosion climate is the dominant factor in soil formation , and soils show the distinctive characteristics of the climate zones in which they form , with a feedback to climate through transfer of carbon stocked in soil horizons back to the atmosphere the type and amount of precipitation influence soil formation by affecting the movement of ions and particles through the soil , and aid in the development of different soil profiles topography determines the rate of precipitation or runoff and rate of formation or erosion of the surface soil profile for all of these reasons , steep slopes prevent the formation of soil from getting very far ahead of soil destruction soils at the bottom of a hill will get more water than soils on the slopes , and soils on the slopes that face the sun path will be drier than soils on slopes that do not topography determines exposure to weather , fire , and other forces of man and nature recurring patterns of topography result in toposequences or soil catenas these same differences are important to understanding natural history and when managing the land resource each soil has a unique combination of microbial , plant , animal and human influences acting upon it in more recent times , human destruction of natural vegetation and subsequent tillage of the soil for crop production has abruptly modified soil formation the effects of ancient ecosystems are not as easily observed , and this challenges the understanding of soil formation the original soil surface is buried , and the formation process must begin anew for this deposit time as a soil-forming factor may be investigated by studying soil chronosequences , in which soils of different ages but with minor differences in other soil-forming factors can be compared soil moisture content and water flow through the soil profile support leaching of solute , and eluviation

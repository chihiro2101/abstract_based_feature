soil develops through a series of changes primitive microbes feed on simple compounds ( nutrients ) released by weathering , and produce acids which contribute to weathering new soils increase in depth by a combination of weathering , and further deposition an estimated soil production function fits observations rates gradually soil is able to support higher forms of plants and animals , starting with pioneer species , and proceeding to more complex soil food web as soils mature , they develop layers as organic matter accumulates and leaching takes place factors of soil formation soil formation is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil they are : parent material , climate , topography ( relief ) , organisms , and time when reordered to climate , relief , organisms , parent material , and time , they form the acronym cropt the mineral material from which a soil forms is called parent material rock , whether its origin is igneous , sedimentary , or metamorphic , is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen , hydrogen and carbon as the parent material is chemically and physically weathered , transported , deposited and precipitated , it is transformed into a soil residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary bedrock transported materials are those that have been deposited by water , wind , ice or gravity marine deposits , such as soils along the atlantic and gulf coasts and in the imperial valley of california of the united states , are the beds of ancient seas that have been revealed as the land uplifted ice moves parent material and makes deposits in the form of terminal and lateral moraines in the case of stationary glaciers parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as scree and is called colluvial material this includes peat and muck soils and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table physical disintegration is the first stage in the transformation of parent material into soil cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size , as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind , water , and gravity finally , organisms reduce parent material in size and create crevices and pores through the mechanical action of plant roots and the digging activity of animals grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation for example , the hydrolysis of orthoclase-feldspar transforms it to acid silicate clay and basic potassium hydroxide , both of which are more soluble of the above , hydrolysis and carbonation are the most effective , in particular in regions of high rainfall , temperature and physical erosion this stems in latitudinal and altitudinal climate gradients in regolith formation if warm temperatures and abundant water are present in the profile at the same time , the processes of weathering , leaching , and plant growth will be maximized to be effective in soil formation , water must penetrate the regolith the greater the depth of water penetration , the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development surplus water percolating through the soil profile transports soluble and suspended materials from the upper layers ( eluviation ) to the lower layers ( illuviation ) , including clay particles and dissolved organic matter soluble salts are not leached from these soils , and in some cases they build up to levels that curtail plant and microbial growth soil profiles in arid and semi-arid regions are also apt to accumulate carbonates and certain types of expansive clays ( calcrete or caliche horizons ) the type and amount of precipitation influence soil formation by affecting the movement of ions and particles through the soil , and aid in the development of different soil profiles soil profiles are more distinct in wet and cool climates , where organic materials may accumulate , than in wet and warm climates , where organic materials are rapidly consumed climate also indirectly influences soil formation through the effects of vegetation cover and biological activity , which modify the rates of chemical reactions in the soil topography determines the rate of precipitation or runoff and rate of formation or erosion of the surface soil profile for all of these reasons , steep slopes prevent the formation of soil from getting very far ahead of soil destruction soils at the bottom of a hill will get more water than soils on the slopes , and soils on the slopes that face the sun path will be drier than soils on slopes that do not termites and ants may also retard soil profile development by denuding large areas of soil around their nests , leading to increased loss of soil by erosion likewise , irrigation soil in an arid region drastically influences soil-forming factors , as does adding fertilizer and lime to soils of low fertility the original soil surface is buried , and the formation process must begin anew for this deposit soil acidification resulting from soil respiration supports chemical weathering transported constituents are deposited due to differences in soil moisture and soil chemistry , especially soil ph and redox potential

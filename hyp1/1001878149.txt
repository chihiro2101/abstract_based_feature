soil develops through a series of changes primitive microbes feed on simple compounds ( nutrients ) released by weathering , and produce acids which contribute to weathering an estimated soil production function fits observations rates gradually soil is able to support higher forms of plants and animals , starting with pioneer species , and proceeding to more complex soil food web topsoils deepen through soil mixing as soils mature , they develop layers as organic matter accumulates and leaching takes place this development of layers is the beginning of the soil profile factors of soil formation soil formation is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil they are : parent material , climate , topography ( relief ) , organisms , and time when reordered to climate , relief , organisms , parent material , and time , they form the acronym cropt the mineral material from which a soil forms is called parent material as the parent material is chemically and physically weathered , transported , deposited and precipitated , it is transformed into a soil the soils found on mesas , plateaux , and plains are residual soils most soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind , water , ice and gravity physical disintegration begins as rocks that have solidified deep in the earth are exposed to lower pressure near the surface and swell and become mechanically unstable grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation hydration is the inclusion of water in a mineral structure , causing it to swell and leaving it stressed and easily decomposed chemical weathering becomes more effective as the surface area of the rock increases , thus is favoured by physical disintegration the principal climatic variables influencing soil formation are effective precipitation ( i.e if warm temperatures and abundant water are present in the profile at the same time , the processes of weathering , leaching , and plant growth will be maximized water is essential for all the major chemical weathering reactions to be effective in soil formation , water must penetrate the regolith it may also carry away soluble materials in the surface drainage waters the type and amount of precipitation influence soil formation by affecting the movement of ions and particles through the soil , and aid in the development of different soil profiles soil profiles are more distinct in wet and cool climates , where organic materials may accumulate , than in wet and warm climates , where organic materials are rapidly consumed by the same process freeze-thaw cycles are an effective mechanism which breaks up rocks and other consolidated materials climate also indirectly influences soil formation through the effects of vegetation cover and biological activity , which modify the rates of chemical reactions in the soil the topography , or relief , is characterized by the inclination ( slope ) , elevation , and orientation of the terrain topography determines the rate of precipitation or runoff and rate of formation or erosion of the surface soil profile steep slopes encourage rapid soil loss by erosion and allow less rainfall to enter the soil before running off and hence , little mineral deposition in lower profiles in semiarid regions , the lower effective rainfall on steeper slopes also results in less complete vegetative cover , so there is less plant contribution to soil formation soils at the bottom of a hill will get more water than soils on the slopes , and soils on the slopes that face the sun path will be drier than soils on slopes that do not mineral accumulations , plant nutrients , type of vegetation , vegetation growth , erosion , and water drainage are dependent on topographic relief depressions allow the accumulation of water , minerals and organic matter and in the extreme , the resulting soils will be saline marshes or peat bogs recurring patterns of topography result in toposequences or soil catenas these same differences are important to understanding natural history and when managing the land resource additionally , some bacteria can fix atmospheric nitrogen and some fungi are efficient at extracting deep soil phosphorus and increasing soil carbon levels in the form of glomalin micro-organisms , including fungi and bacteria , effect chemical exchanges between roots and soil and act as a reserve of nutrients in a soil biological hotspot called rhizosphere in more recent times , human destruction of natural vegetation and subsequent tillage of the soil for crop production has abruptly modified soil formation that time period depends strongly on climate , parent material , relief , and biotic activity soil mixing ( pedoturbation ) is often an important factor in soil formation key soil forming processes especially important to macro-scale patterns of soil formation are : laterite podsolization calcification salinization gleysol

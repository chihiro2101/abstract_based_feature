an estimated soil production function fits observations rates gradually soil is able to support higher forms of plants and animals , starting with pioneer species , and proceeding to more complex soil food web soils deepen with accumulation of humus primarily due to the activities of higher plants as soils mature , they develop layers as organic matter accumulates and leaching takes place this development of layers is the beginning of the soil profile factors of soil formation soil formation is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil when reordered to climate , relief , organisms , parent material , and time , they form the acronym cropt the mineral material from which a soil forms is called parent material rock , whether its origin is igneous , sedimentary , or metamorphic , is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen , hydrogen and carbon residual materials are mineral materials that have weathered in place from primary bedrock most soils derive from transported materials that have been moved many miles by wind , water , ice and gravity lake bonneville and many soils around the great lakes of the united states are examples retreating glaciers leave smoother ground moraines and in all cases , outwash plains are left as alluvial deposits are moved downstream from the glacier this includes peat and muck soils and results from preservation of plant residues by the low oxygen content of a high water table the weathering of parent material takes the form of physical weathering ( disintegration ) , chemical weathering ( decomposition ) and chemical transformation weathering is usually confined to the top few meters of geologic material , because physical , chemical , and biological stresses and fluctuations generally decrease with depth chemical decomposition is a function of mineral solubility , the rate of which doubles with each 10 & nbsp ; Â°c rise in temperature , but is strongly dependent on water to effect chemical changes structural changes are the result of hydration , oxidation , and reduction physical disintegration is the first stage in the transformation of parent material into soil cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size , as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind , water , and gravity water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying , thereby stressing the rock grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation chemical decomposition and structural changes result when minerals are made soluble by water or are changed in structure the first three of the following list are solubility changes and the last three are structural changes the mineralogical and chemical composition of the primary bedrock material , its physical features , including grain size and degree of consolidation , and the rate and type of weathering transforms the parent material into a different mineral the texture , ph and mineral constituents of saprolite are inherited from its parent material to be effective in soil formation , water must penetrate the regolith the seasonal rainfall distribution , evaporative losses , site topography , and soil permeability interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation the greater the depth of water penetration , the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development it may also carry away soluble materials in the surface drainage waters the type and amount of precipitation influence soil formation by affecting the movement of ions and particles through the soil , and aid in the development of different soil profiles the topography , or relief , is characterized by the inclination ( slope ) , elevation , and orientation of the terrain topography determines the rate of precipitation or runoff and rate of formation or erosion of the surface soil profile in semiarid regions , the lower effective rainfall on steeper slopes also results in less complete vegetative cover , so there is less plant contribution to soil formation therefore , soils on steep terrain tend to have rather shallow , poorly developed profiles in comparison to soils on nearby , more level sites soils at the bottom of a hill will get more water than soils on the slopes , and soils on the slopes that face the sun path will be drier than soils on slopes that do not micro-organisms , including fungi and bacteria , effect chemical exchanges between roots and soil and act as a reserve of nutrients in a soil biological hotspot called rhizosphere they aerate and stir the soil and create stable soil aggregates , after having disrupted links between soil particles during the intestinal transit of ingested soil , thereby assuring ready infiltration of water over time the soil will develop a profile that depends on the intensities of biota and climate eluvium is the translocation of colloid material , such as organic matter , clay and other mineral compounds transported constituents are deposited due to differences in soil moisture and soil chemistry , especially soil ph and redox potential a variety of mechanisms contribute to soil formation , including siltation , erosion , overpressure and lake bed succession

soil develops through a series of changes primitive microbes feed on simple compounds ( nutrients ) released by weathering , and produce acids which contribute to weathering new soils increase in depth by a combination of weathering , and further deposition an estimated soil production function fits observations rates gradually soil is able to support higher forms of plants and animals , starting with pioneer species , and proceeding to more complex soil food web as soils mature , they develop layers as organic matter accumulates and leaching takes place this development of layers is the beginning of the soil profile factors of soil formation soil formation is influenced by at least five classic factors that are intertwined in the evolution of a soil when reordered to climate , relief , organisms , parent material , and time , they form the acronym cropt the mineral material from which a soil forms is called parent material rock , whether its origin is igneous , sedimentary , or metamorphic , is the source of all soil mineral materials and the origin of all plant nutrients with the exceptions of nitrogen , hydrogen and carbon as the parent material is chemically and physically weathered , transported , deposited and precipitated , it is transformed into a soil residual soils are soils that develop from their underlying parent rocks and have the same general chemistry as those rocks the soils found on mesas , plateaux , and plains are residual soils parent material moved by gravity is obvious at the base of steep slopes as scree and is called colluvial material the weathering of parent material takes the form of physical weathering ( disintegration ) , chemical weathering ( decomposition ) and chemical transformation chemical weathering mainly results from the excretion of organic acids and chelating compounds by bacteria and fungi , thought to increase under present-day greenhouse effect temperature fluctuations cause expansion and contraction of the rock , splitting it along lines of weakness cycles of wetting and drying cause soil particles to be abraded to a finer size , as does the physical rubbing of material as it is moved by wind , water , and gravity water can deposit within rocks minerals that expand upon drying , thereby stressing the rock grinding of parent material by rock-eating animals also contributes to incipient soil formation in carbonation , the solution of carbon dioxide in water forms carbonic acid hydration is the inclusion of water in a mineral structure , causing it to swell and leaving it stressed and easily decomposed the reduction of minerals leaves them electrically unstable , more soluble and internally stressed and easily decomposed , precipitation minus evapotranspiration ) and temperature , both of which affect the rates of chemical , physical , and biological processes in contrast , grasses are the dominant native vegetation in subhumid and semiarid regions , while shrubs and brush of various kinds dominate in arid areas to be effective in soil formation , water must penetrate the regolith the seasonal rainfall distribution , evaporative losses , site topography , and soil permeability interact to determine how effectively precipitation can influence soil formation the greater the depth of water penetration , the greater the depth of weathering of the soil and its development it may also carry away soluble materials in the surface drainage waters soil profiles in arid and semi-arid regions are also apt to accumulate carbonates and certain types of expansive clays ( calcrete or caliche horizons ) the type and amount of precipitation influence soil formation by affecting the movement of ions and particles through the soil , and aid in the development of different soil profiles climate also indirectly influences soil formation through the effects of vegetation cover and biological activity , which modify the rates of chemical reactions in the soil intermediate topography affords the best conditions for the formation of an agriculturally productive soil these same differences are important to understanding natural history and when managing the land resource each soil has a unique combination of microbial , plant , animal and human influences acting upon it microorganisms are particularly influential in the mineral transformations critical to the soil forming process their grazing results in the weathering of the stones , and the subsequent formation of soil while a soil can achieve relative stability of its properties for extended periods , the soil life cycle ultimately ends in soil conditions that leave it vulnerable to erosion paleosols are soils formed during previous soil forming conditions soil mixing ( pedoturbation ) is often an important factor in soil formation the interplay of removal and deposition results in contrasting soil horizons

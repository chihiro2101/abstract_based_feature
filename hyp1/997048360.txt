'' brilliant female vocalist , experienced gigs/studio , seeks great rootsy soul/r & b band.â€”alison , basildon '' moyet was surprised when the only reply she received was from vince clarke , a fellow basildon native who had recently stunned the music press by quitting depeche mode after their debut album and three hit singles , all of which he had written despite growing up in the same town and having attended the same saturday music school when they were eleven years old , moyet and clarke did not know each other well and had never spoken to each other previously moyet had been in the same class at school as clarke 's future depeche mode bandmates martin gore and andy fletcher but had little contact with clarke himself , remembering him as an outsider who , with his brothers , would wear t-shirts proclaiming their christianity clarke had seen moyet sing live a few times , as his best friend had been in her punk band in an early interview , moyet stated that '' i 'm a traditionalist , i ca n't accept the fact of blues with synthesizers at all , '' while clarke admitted to tolerating modern r & b outfits like dr clarke took the demo to mute label boss daniel miller but recalled that at first miller appeared to be uninterested : '' i tried to give it to daniel and he did n't show much interest & nbsp ; by this point clarke had already written '' do n't go '' , but both he and moyet felt it was too good to be the b-side of '' only you '' , so they quickly wrote the song '' situation '' together for the single 's b-side according to moyet , the name yazoo was taken from the specialist blues record label yazoo records clarke had expected that miller would produce the album , but discovered that miller was already otherwise occupied , so blackwing studio owner eric radcliffe carried out production duties with clarke and moyet '' do n't go '' was released in july 1982 as the second single in the uk and also reached the top three of the uk charts after releasing '' the other side of love '' in the uk in november 1982 , a non-album stopgap single that reached number 13 in the uk singles chart , the duo went back to blackwing to record their second album clarke had always seen upstairs at eric 's as a one-off project and had to be persuaded to make another yazoo record by his publishers , who felt it would not go down well if he was seen to walk out of a second band within a year of the first unlike their first record , the second album was made over a longer period of four months and with clarke and moyet rarely in the studio together at the same time ; clarke would record instrumental tracks in the morning and moyet would come in during the evening and record her vocals a single , '' nobody 's diary '' , was released in may 1983 ahead of the album and reached number three in the uk charts , but within days of the single 's release , yazoo announced that they were splitting up the album , ironically titled you and me both , was released in the uk in july 1983 and topped the uk album charts , a feat it would also achieve in new zealand however , with no further singles or live appearances to promote it , it did not sell as well as upstairs at eric 's , although it still achieved gold status in the uk for sales of 100,000 copies '' situation '' was finally released as a single in the uk in 1990 in another remixed form , which was moderately successful , reaching number 14 on the uk singles chart on 13 december , the planet sound music magazine pages on the uk 's teletext service on channel 4 exclusively revealed that both yazoo albums were to be reissued and that the duo were planning to reform and play a gig in support of the albums ' release in an interview in may 2008 with the online magazine side-line , clarke said that there were plans to record the two london shows on the tour for a possible live album in the future

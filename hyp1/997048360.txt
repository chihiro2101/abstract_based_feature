'' brilliant female vocalist , experienced gigs/studio , seeks great rootsy soul/r & b band.—alison , basildon '' moyet was surprised when the only reply she received was from vince clarke , a fellow basildon native who had recently stunned the music press by quitting depeche mode after their debut album and three hit singles , all of which he had written moyet had been in the same class at school as clarke 's future depeche mode bandmates martin gore and andy fletcher but had little contact with clarke himself , remembering him as an outsider who , with his brothers , would wear t-shirts proclaiming their christianity clarke was worried that by walking out of depeche mode he would lose his record deal with mute records and wanted to show the label that he still had something to offer them , saying in a 2008 interview , '' when i left depeche i was n't sure i 'd still have a record deal and was keen to play the label something of my own , so i wrote the song 'only you ' but needed someone to demo it with in an early interview , moyet stated that '' i 'm a traditionalist , i ca n't accept the fact of blues with synthesizers at all , '' while clarke admitted to tolerating modern r & b outfits like dr clarke took the demo to mute label boss daniel miller but recalled that at first miller appeared to be uninterested : '' i tried to give it to daniel and he did n't show much interest & nbsp ; '' mute asked the duo to record the song as a single and to make an album together by this point clarke had already written '' do n't go '' , but both he and moyet felt it was too good to be the b-side of '' only you '' , so they quickly wrote the song '' situation '' together for the single 's b-side according to moyet , the name yazoo was taken from the specialist blues record label yazoo records the duo recorded their debut album at blackwing studios in southeast london , where clarke had recorded depeche mode 's album speak & spell the previous year clarke had expected that miller would produce the album , but discovered that miller was already otherwise occupied , so blackwing studio owner eric radcliffe carried out production duties with clarke and moyet '' do n't go '' was released in july 1982 as the second single in the uk and also reached the top three of the uk charts in north america , '' situation '' had been a hit in the clubs in a version remixed by new york city-based dj françois kevorkian , and against the band 's wishes , it was released as yazoo 's debut single in the us and canada , where it reached number 73 on the billboard hot 100 after releasing '' the other side of love '' in the uk in november 1982 , a non-album stopgap single that reached number 13 in the uk singles chart , the duo went back to blackwing to record their second album unlike their first record , the second album was made over a longer period of four months and with clarke and moyet rarely in the studio together at the same time ; clarke would record instrumental tracks in the morning and moyet would come in during the evening and record her vocals a single , '' nobody 's diary '' , was released in may 1983 ahead of the album and reached number three in the uk charts , but within days of the single 's release , yazoo announced that they were splitting up the album , ironically titled you and me both , was released in the uk in july 1983 and topped the uk album charts , a feat it would also achieve in new zealand '' situation '' was finally released as a single in the uk in 1990 in another remixed form , which was moderately successful , reaching number 14 on the uk singles chart clarke was tapped to remix moyet 's 1994 single '' whispering your name '' and , with erasure , clarke and moyet tried to record her single '' this house '' as a duet , but the project was never realized because sony music entertainment would not permit it in an interview in may 2008 with the online magazine side-line , clarke said that there were plans to record the two london shows on the tour for a possible live album in the future

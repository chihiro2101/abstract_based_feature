moyet had been in the same class at school as clarke 's future depeche mode bandmates martin gore and andy fletcher but had little contact with clarke himself , remembering him as an outsider who , with his brothers , would wear t-shirts proclaiming their christianity clarke had seen moyet sing live a few times , as his best friend had been in her punk band clarke was worried that by walking out of depeche mode he would lose his record deal with mute records and wanted to show the label that he still had something to offer them , saying in a 2008 interview , '' when i left depeche i was n't sure i 'd still have a record deal and was keen to play the label something of my own , so i wrote the song 'only you ' but needed someone to demo it with clarke took the demo to mute label boss daniel miller but recalled that at first miller appeared to be uninterested : '' i tried to give it to daniel and he did n't show much interest & nbsp ; by this point clarke had already written '' do n't go '' , but both he and moyet felt it was too good to be the b-side of '' only you '' , so they quickly wrote the song '' situation '' together for the single 's b-side this decision led to a £3.5 & nbsp ; million lawsuit threat by the label over the band 's name and , coupled with the fact that the name yazoo was already in use by a small american rock band , the group was renamed yaz for the north american market the duo recorded their debut album at blackwing studios in southeast london , where clarke had recorded depeche mode 's album speak & spell the previous year clarke had expected that miller would produce the album , but discovered that miller was already otherwise occupied , so blackwing studio owner eric radcliffe carried out production duties with clarke and moyet '' do n't go '' was released in july 1982 as the second single in the uk and also reached the top three of the uk charts upstairs at eric 's was released in the uk in august 1982 , peaking at number two on the uk albums chart and going on to sell more than 300,000 copies and achieving platinum status in the us , initial success was more modest and the album peaked at number 92 on the billboard 200 album chart , but by 1989 , seven years after its release , word of mouth had helped to push the album to platinum status for sales of over one million copies clarke had always seen upstairs at eric 's as a one-off project and had to be persuaded to make another yazoo record by his publishers , who felt it would not go down well if he was seen to walk out of a second band within a year of the first unlike their first record , the second album was made over a longer period of four months and with clarke and moyet rarely in the studio together at the same time ; clarke would record instrumental tracks in the morning and moyet would come in during the evening and record her vocals a single , '' nobody 's diary '' , was released in may 1983 ahead of the album and reached number three in the uk charts , but within days of the single 's release , yazoo announced that they were splitting up '' he put it down to the fact that because the duo became popular so rapidly , there had never been any time to build up a personal relationship between them : '' it all happened very fast and because we had n't been in a band for years , playing in clubs , it was very much just a working relationship—we never had the chance to bond clarke was tapped to remix moyet 's 1994 single '' whispering your name '' and , with erasure , clarke and moyet tried to record her single '' this house '' as a duet , but the project was never realized because sony music entertainment would not permit it clarke welcomed her message , but replied that he was now committed to his current band erasure and felt it would be disloyal to his musical partner andy bell if he returned to work with moyet on 13 december , the planet sound music magazine pages on the uk 's teletext service on channel 4 exclusively revealed that both yazoo albums were to be reissued and that the duo were planning to reform and play a gig in support of the albums ' release in an interview in may 2008 with the online magazine side-line , clarke said that there were plans to record the two london shows on the tour for a possible live album in the future

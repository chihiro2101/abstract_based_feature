the first known use in print of the term perfect game occurred in 1908 sanborn 's report for the chicago tribune about addie joss 's performance against the white sox calls it '' an absolutely perfect game , without run , without hit , and without letting an opponent reach first base by hook or crook , on hit , walk , or error , in nine innings '' writeups for the ward perfect game of 1880 and the young game of 1904 describe the games as '' wonderful '' and other effusive terms , but do not use the term '' perfect game '' several sources have claimed that the first recorded usage of the term perfect game was by ernest lanigan in his baseball cyclopedia , made in reference to charlie robertson 's 1922 perfect game the baseball cyclopedia reference came in a supplement to the 1922 edition of the book ( a publication of baseball magazine ) and was worded thus : '' charles robertson of chicago americans pitched an absolutely perfect no-hit game against detroit on april 30 , 1922 , no one reaching first '' the publication listed all the perfect games to that point ( a total of five , including robertson 's ) and used the term '' perfect game '' matter-of-factly , possibly indicating the term was already familiar to the readership lanigan 's work references a 1914 book called balldom as a source for his list of perfect games , although balldom itself does not use the term '' perfect game '' , merely characterizing the games as '' no batter reached first base '' lanigan was also familiar with sanborn 's baseball articles , making various references to him elsewhere in the cyclopedia , although there is nothing indicating that sanborn necessarily inspired lanigan 's use of the term that decision removed a number of games that had long appeared in the record books : those lasting fewer than nine innings , and those in which a team went hitless in regulation but then got a hit in extra innings the definition of perfect game was made to parallel this new definition of the no-hitter , in effect substituting '' baserunner '' for '' hit '' as a result of the 1991 redefinition , for instance , harvey haddix receives credit for neither a perfect game nor a no-hitter for his performance on may 26 , 1959 , when he threw 12 perfect innings against the milwaukee braves before allowing a baserunner in the 13th in a further coincidence , larsen was in attendance when the third yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game , david cone in 1999 , performed the feat on the same day that larsen and yogi berra ( the catcher in the 1956 perfect game ) were invited to do the ceremonial first pitch ron hassey is the only catcher in mlb history to have caught more than one perfect game ( his first was with pitcher len barker in 1981 and his second was with pitcher dennis martínez in 1991 ) the most recent perfect game pitched in major league baseball was thrown by félix hernández of the seattle mariners against the tampa bay rays on august 15 , 2012 the only perfect game thrown in a little league world series championship was by ángel macías of the monterrey , mexico , team in 1957 armando galarraga 's near-perfect game eight-ender in curling for love of the game , a 1991 novel by pulitzer prize–winning author michael shaara golden set in tennis maximum break in snooker nine-dart finish in darts perfect game in bowling the perfect game , a 2009 movie perfect : the inside story of baseball 's seventeen perfect games ( triumph books ) 27 men out : baseball 's perfect games ( new york : atria books )

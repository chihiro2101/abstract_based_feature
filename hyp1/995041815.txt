sanborn 's report for the chicago tribune about addie joss 's performance against the white sox calls it '' an absolutely perfect game , without run , without hit , and without letting an opponent reach first base by hook or crook , on hit , walk , or error , in nine innings '' a double error by cleveland resulted in the lone run scoring , and the writer described it as '' the only lapse from perfect play made by the clevelands during the game '' ; the use of the word '' perfect '' in this context refers only to defensive play , a different meaning than its modern baseball sense , as cleveland 's pitcher also surrendered three hits and a walk writeups for the ward perfect game of 1880 and the young game of 1904 describe the games as '' wonderful '' and other effusive terms , but do not use the term '' perfect game '' several sources have claimed that the first recorded usage of the term perfect game was by ernest lanigan in his baseball cyclopedia , made in reference to charlie robertson 's 1922 perfect game the baseball cyclopedia reference came in a supplement to the 1922 edition of the book ( a publication of baseball magazine ) and was worded thus : '' charles robertson of chicago americans pitched an absolutely perfect no-hit game against detroit on april 30 , 1922 , no one reaching first '' the publication listed all the perfect games to that point ( a total of five , including robertson 's ) and used the term '' perfect game '' matter-of-factly , possibly indicating the term was already familiar to the readership lanigan 's work references a 1914 book called balldom as a source for his list of perfect games , although balldom itself does not use the term '' perfect game '' , merely characterizing the games as '' no batter reached first base the chicago tribune came close to the term in describing lee richmond 's game for worcester in 1880 : '' richmond was most effectively supported , every position on the home nine being played to perfection similarly , in writing up john montgomery ward 's 1880 perfect game , the new york clipper described the '' perfect play '' of providence 's defense as of 2014 , the current major league baseball definition of a perfect game is largely a side effect of the decision made by the major leagues ' committee for statistical accuracy on september 4 , 1991 , to redefine a no-hitter as a game in which the pitcher or pitchers on one team throw a complete game of nine innings or more without surrendering a hit the definition of perfect game was made to parallel this new definition of the no-hitter , in effect substituting '' baserunner '' for '' hit '' as a result of the 1991 redefinition , for instance , harvey haddix receives credit for neither a perfect game nor a no-hitter for his performance on may 26 , 1959 , when he threw 12 perfect innings against the milwaukee braves before allowing a baserunner in the 13th there has been one perfect game in the world series , thrown by don larsen for the new york yankees against the brooklyn dodgers on october 8 , 1956 by coincidence , the second yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game , david wells in 1998 , graduated from the same high school as larsen - point loma high school in san diego , california in a further coincidence , larsen was in attendance when the third yankee pitcher to throw a perfect game , david cone in 1999 , performed the feat on the same day that larsen and yogi berra ( the catcher in the 1956 perfect game ) were invited to do the ceremonial first pitch since the beginning of the 2009 mlb season , it was the third time that the tampa bay rays were on the losing end of a perfect game the only perfect game thrown in a little league world series championship was by ángel macías of the monterrey , mexico , team in 1957 armando galarraga 's near-perfect game eight-ender in curling for love of the game , a 1991 novel by pulitzer prize–winning author michael shaara golden set in tennis maximum break in snooker nine-dart finish in darts perfect game in bowling the perfect game , a 2009 movie

coordinated movements of the spines enable sand dollars to move across the seabed the velvety spines of live sand dollars appear in a variety of colors—green , blue , violet , or purple—depending on the species the bodies of adult sand dollars , like those of other echinoids , display radial symmetry the mouth of the sand dollar is located on the bottom of its body at the center of the petal-like pattern unlike other urchins , the bodies of sand dollars also display secondary front-to-back bilateral symmetry the anus of sand dollars is located at the back rather than at the top as in most urchins , with many more bilateral features appearing in some species the keyhole sand dollar ( three species , genus mellita ) is found on a wide range of coasts in and around the caribbean sea live sand dollar trying to bury itself in beach sand.jpg living sand dollar the caribbean sand dollar or inflated sea biscuit , clypeaster rosaceus , is thicker in height than most sand dollars live beyond the mean low water line on top of or just beneath the surface of sandy or muddy areas recent research has shown that the larvae of some sand dollars clone themselves when they detect predators ( by sensing dissolved fish mucus ) the ancestors of sand dollars diverged from the other irregular echinoids , namely the cassiduloida , during the early jurassic , rapid evolution in echinoids with the first true sand dollar genus , togocyamus , arising during the paleocene

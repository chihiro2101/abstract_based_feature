in 1987 , kent beck and ward cunningham began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming – specifically pattern languages – and presented their results at the oopsla conference that year design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book design patterns was published in 1994 by the so-called '' gang of four '' ( gamma et al that same year , the first pattern languages of programming conference was held , and the following year the portland pattern repository was set up for documentation of design patterns notable books in the design pattern genre include : although design patterns have been applied practically for a long time , formalization of the concept of design patterns languished for several years effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation in order to achieve flexibility , design patterns usually introduce additional levels of indirection , which in some cases may complicate the resulting designs and hurt application performance design patterns provide general solutions , documented in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem efforts have also been made to codify design patterns in particular domains , including use of existing design patterns as well as domain specific design patterns finally , behavioral patterns are about identifying common communication patterns between objects and realize these patterns the documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used , the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve , and the suggested solution related patterns : other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern ; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns

in 1987 , kent beck and ward cunningham began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming – specifically pattern languages – and presented their results at the oopsla conference that year design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book design patterns was published in 1994 by the so-called '' gang of four '' ( gamma et al that same year , the first pattern languages of programming conference was held , and the following year the portland pattern repository was set up for documentation of design patterns notable books in the design pattern genre include : although design patterns have been applied practically for a long time , formalization of the concept of design patterns languished for several years design patterns can speed up the development process by providing tested , proven development paradigms these sections describe a design motif : a prototypical micro-architecture that developers copy and adapt to their particular designs to solve the recurrent problem described by the design pattern efforts have also been made to codify design patterns in particular domains , including use of existing design patterns as well as domain specific design patterns structural patterns are about organizing different classes and objects to form larger structures and provide new functionality the documentation for a design pattern describes the context in which the pattern is used , the forces within the context that the pattern seeks to resolve , and the suggested solution one example of a commonly used documentation format is the one used by erich gamma , richard helm , ralph johnson , and john vlissides in their book design patterns related patterns : other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern ; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns

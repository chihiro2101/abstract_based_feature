patterns originated as an architectural concept by christopher alexander as early as 1977 ( c.f in 1987 , kent beck and ward cunningham began experimenting with the idea of applying patterns to programming – specifically pattern languages – and presented their results at the oopsla conference that year design patterns gained popularity in computer science after the book design patterns was published in 1994 by the so-called '' gang of four '' ( gamma et al that same year , the first pattern languages of programming conference was held , and the following year the portland pattern repository was set up for documentation of design patterns notable books in the design pattern genre include : although design patterns have been applied practically for a long time , formalization of the concept of design patterns languished for several years effective software design requires considering issues that may not become visible until later in the implementation reusing design patterns helps to prevent such subtle issues , and it also improves code readability for coders and architects who are familiar with the patterns since some authors see this as a step backward from software reuse as provided by components , researchers have worked to turn patterns into components design patterns provide general solutions , documented in a format that does not require specifics tied to a particular problem developers use the design pattern by introducing in their designs this prototypical micro-architecture , which means that micro-architectures in their designs will have structure and organization similar to the chosen design motif related patterns : other patterns that have some relationship with the pattern ; discussion of the differences between the pattern and similar patterns

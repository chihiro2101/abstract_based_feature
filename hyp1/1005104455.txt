the short drop is a method of hanging performed by placing the condemned prisoner on a raised support such as a stool , ladder , cart , or other vehicle , with the noose around the neck the support is then moved away , leaving the person dangling from the rope suspended by the neck , the weight of the body tightens the noose around the neck effecting strangulation and death before 1850 , the short drop was the standard method of hanging , and is still common in suicides and extrajudicial hangings ( such as lynchings and summary executions ) which do not benefit from the specialised equipment and official table of drops used in the newer methods the chest sling is released , and the prisoner is rapidly jerked downward by the assistant executioners via the foot rope the executioner stands on a stepped platform approximately 1.2 metres high beside the condemned , and guides the head downward with his hand simultaneous to the efforts of his assistants this method was later also adopted by the successor states , most notably by czechoslovakia ; where the '' pole '' method was used as the single type of execution from 1918 until the abolition of capital punishment in 1990 nazi war criminal karl hermann frank , executed in 1946 in prague , was among approximately 1,000 condemned people executed in this manner in czechoslovakia the record speed for a british long drop hanging was 7 seconds from the executioner entering the cell to the drop hanging is a common suicide method full suspension is not required , and for this reason , hanging is especially commonplace among suicidal prisoners ( see suicide watch ) a type of hanging comparable to full suspension hanging may be obtained by self-strangulation using a ligature around the neck and the partial weight of the body ( partial suspension ) to tighten the ligature

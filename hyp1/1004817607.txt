oberholtzer , a history of the united states since the civil war ( 1926 ) 3:79–122 a period of economic overexpansion arose from the northern railroad boom before a series of economic setbacks : the black friday ( 1869 ) , the great chicago fire , an outbreak of equine influenza and the boston fire of 1872 , and the coinage act of 1873 the decision of the german empire to cease minting silver thaler coins in 1871 caused a drop in demand and downward pressure on the value of silver , which , in turn , affected the us since much of the supply of silver was mined there as a result , the us congress passed the coinage act of 1873 , which changed the national silver policy the act also reduced the domestic money supply , raising interest rates and hurting farmers and others who normally carried heavy debt loads the resulting outcry raised serious questions about how long the new policy would last the perception of us instability in its monetary policy caused investors to shy away from long-term obligations , particularly long-term bonds grant 's monetary policy of contracting the money supply and thus raising interest rates made matters worse for those in debt the opening of the suez canal in 1869 was one of the causes of the panic of 1873 because goods from the far east had been carried in sailing vessels around the cape of good hope and were stored in british warehouses despite this , britain did not experience the scale of financial mayhem seen in america and central europe , perhaps forestalled by an expectation that the liquidity-constraining provisions of the bank charter act of 1844 would be suspended as they had been in the crises of 1847 , 1857 , and 1866 musson , '' the great depression in britain , 1873–1896 : a reappraisal still , many corporations were able to reduce production costs and achieve better productivity rates with industrial production increasing by 40 % in britain and by over 100 % in germany a comparison of capital formation rates in both countries helps to account for the different industrial growth rates during the depression , the british ratio of net national capital formation to net national product fell from 11.5 % to 6.0 % , but the german ratio rose from 10.6 % to 15.9 % during the depression , britain took the course of static supply adjustment , but germany stimulated effective demand and expanded industrial supply capacity by increasing and adjusting capital formation

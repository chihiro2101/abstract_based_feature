wind river acquired rights to distribute vrtx and significantly enhanced it by adding , among other things , a file system and an integrated development environment 2010s : vxworks adds support for 64-bit processing and introduces vxworks 7 for iot in 2016 wind river outfits vxworks for the internet of things , computer world vxworks supports intel architecture , power architecture , and arm architectures the rtos can be used in multi-core asymmetric multiprocessing ( amp ) , symmetric multiprocessing ( smp ) , and mixed modes and multi-os ( via type 1 hypervisor ) designs on 32- and 64-bit processors vxworks core development tools are compilers such as diab , gnu , and intel c++ compiler ( icc ) ) and its build and configuration tools wind river reinvents the real-time operating system for the internet of things windriver.com , the following lists some of the release 7 updates more information can be found on the wind rivers vxworks website as is common in embedded system development , cross compiler is used with vxworks wind river reinvents the rtos for the iot , business wire the tornado ide was used for vxworks 5.x and was replaced by the eclipse-based workbench ide for vxworks 6.x workbench is also the ide for the wind river linux , on-chip debugging , and wind river diab compiler product lines it simulates the full target system ( hardware and software ) to create a shared platform for software development information and patches for all vxworks versions affected by urgent/11 vulnerability can be obtained from wind river the wind river vxworks operating system is used on the boeing 787-8 , 787-9 and 787-10 aircraft

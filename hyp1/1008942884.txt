while normal for a road , it is unusually shaped for a race track as it is essentially two long straights in the form of a dual carriageway , with a hairpin corner at each end at the time of opening , avus was & nbsp ; km ( 12 & nbsp ; miles ) long – each straight being approximately half that length , and joined at each end by flat , large-radius curves , driven counter-clockwise while the grand prix motor racing scene still evaded german tracks , the circuit from 1922 was also the site of motorcycle races during the race , in heavy rain , two track marshals died when adolf rosenberger lost control and hit the indicator board and the timekeeper 's box , with a third employee succumbing to his injuries in hospital a few hours later from 1927 the german grand prix was relocated to the new and more secure nürburgring circuit in the western german eifel range , while the avus received a new asphalt surface and served as an experimental track for rocket cars in an effort to make avus the '' world 's fastest race track '' , the 1936 season was skipped and while the track hosted the cycling road race , the marathon and 50 & nbsp ; km walk athletic events of the 1936 summer olympics , the north curve was turned into a steeply banked turn ( 43° ) made of bricks as the avus race did not count towards the championship , non-gp cars were allowed , which permitted the use of streamlined cars , similar to the cars used for high speed record attempts mercedes driver hermann lang 's average race speed of about was the fastest road race in history for nearly five decades , and was not matched on a high-speed banked-circuit until the mid-1980s at the 1986 indianapolis 500 no major race was held after 1937 as , in early 1938 , the popular german race driver bernd rosemeyer was killed in a land speed record attempt on a straight section of the autobahn frankfurt–darmstadt ( present-day bundesautobahn 5 ) , at which point the high-speed avus was considered too dangerous for the fast grand prix race cars a planned banked south turn was never built ; the cleared grounds in the grunewald forest were used as a proving ground ( '' keerans range '' ) by the american occupation forces after world war ii the first avus race after the war was held on 1 july 1951 for formula two and formula three cars , won by east german driver paul greifzu finally avus hosted its only world championship formula one race with the 1959 german grand prix on 2 august , won by tony brooks

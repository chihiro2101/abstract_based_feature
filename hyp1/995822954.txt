by the late 1930s , both vickers and sperry had developed predictors for use against high-altitude bombers however , low-flying aircraft presented a very different problem , with very short engagement times and high angular rates of motion , but at the same time less need for ballistic accuracy the british army 's new bofors 40 mm guns were intended as their standard low-altitude anti-aircraft weapons the predictor solved the problem by doing all of the calculations mechanically through a complex system of gears inputs to its calculations included wind speed , ballistics of the gun and the rounds it fired , angle to the target in azimuth and altitude , and a user-input estimated target speed the kerrison predictor did not calculate fuse settings , as the shells fired by the 40 & nbsp ; mm bofors gun , with which it was designed to work , were contact-fused with the demands of the raf for almost all light metals and machinists , the predictor was far too difficult for the army to produce in any quantity the no.7 anti-aircraft composite predictor , also designed by kerrison was similar in some ways although it was more accurate than the kerrison predictor , sperry was unable to keep up with production of its more expensive and complex m-7 director the predictor 's plans were passed to sperry corporation , who were just commencing production of their own complex high-altitude system , the m7 computing sight , and had no excess capacity to produce the new design as well ( excerpt from ) with aircraft speeds increasing dramatically during the war , even the speed of the kerrison predictor proved lacking by the end

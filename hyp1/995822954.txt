by the late 1930s , both vickers and sperry had developed predictors for use against high-altitude bombers the kerrison predictor was a relatively simple device compared to high-altitude predictors and was designed to meet these particular requirements the predictor solved the problem by doing all of the calculations mechanically through a complex system of gears the kerrison predictor did not calculate fuse settings , as the shells fired by the 40 & nbsp ; mm bofors gun , with which it was designed to work , were contact-fused with the demands of the raf for almost all light metals and machinists , the predictor was far too difficult for the army to produce in any quantity it was later adapted for use with the 40 & nbsp ; mm bofors although it was more accurate than the kerrison predictor , sperry was unable to keep up with production of its more expensive and complex m-7 director in september 1940 , george marshall asked the british for the loan of four bofors 40 & nbsp ; mm guns with kerrison predictors for testing during testing the kerrison predictor provided accurate fire control to a range in excess of , and the bofors gun was reliable in the fall of 1940 , the ordnance department standardized the kerrison predictor for use with their 37 & nbsp ; mm gun in december 1940 the singer corporation was contracted to produce 1,500 predictors per month to equip the army 's existing 37 & nbsp ; mm guns while production of the 40 & nbsp ; mm bofors was ramped up

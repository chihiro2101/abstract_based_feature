by the late 1930s , both vickers and sperry had developed predictors for use against high-altitude bombers however , low-flying aircraft presented a very different problem , with very short engagement times and high angular rates of motion , but at the same time less need for ballistic accuracy the british army 's new bofors 40 mm guns were intended as their standard low-altitude anti-aircraft weapons the kerrison predictor was a relatively simple device compared to high-altitude predictors and was designed to meet these particular requirements the gunners simply kept the gun loaded , while the three aimers simply had to point the predictor , mounted on a large tripod , at the target the kerrison predictor did not calculate fuse settings , as the shells fired by the 40 & nbsp ; mm bofors gun , with which it was designed to work , were contact-fused while the predictor proved to be an excellent addition to the bofors , it was not without its faults the no.7 anti-aircraft composite predictor , also designed by kerrison was similar in some ways in september 1940 , george marshall asked the british for the loan of four bofors 40 & nbsp ; mm guns with kerrison predictors for testing during testing the kerrison predictor provided accurate fire control to a range in excess of , and the bofors gun was reliable in the fall of 1940 , the ordnance department standardized the kerrison predictor for use with their 37 & nbsp ; mm gun

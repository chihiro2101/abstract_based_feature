by the late 1930s , both vickers and sperry had developed predictors for use against high-altitude bombers however , low-flying aircraft presented a very different problem , with very short engagement times and high angular rates of motion , but at the same time less need for ballistic accuracy the british army 's new bofors 40 mm guns were intended as their standard low-altitude anti-aircraft weapons the kerrison predictor was a relatively simple device compared to high-altitude predictors and was designed to meet these particular requirements inputs to its calculations included wind speed , ballistics of the gun and the rounds it fired , angle to the target in azimuth and altitude , and a user-input estimated target speed the no.7 anti-aircraft composite predictor , also designed by kerrison was similar in some ways although it was more accurate than the kerrison predictor , sperry was unable to keep up with production of its more expensive and complex m-7 director in the fall of 1940 , the ordnance department standardized the kerrison predictor for use with their 37 & nbsp ; mm gun the predictor 's plans were passed to sperry corporation , who were just commencing production of their own complex high-altitude system , the m7 computing sight , and had no excess capacity to produce the new design as well ( excerpt from ) with aircraft speeds increasing dramatically during the war , even the speed of the kerrison predictor proved lacking by the end as the power of the systems grew , they eventually evolved into motion control photography , a widely used technique in special effects filming

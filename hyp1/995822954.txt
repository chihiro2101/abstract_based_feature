however , low-flying aircraft presented a very different problem , with very short engagement times and high angular rates of motion , but at the same time less need for ballistic accuracy the british army 's new bofors 40 mm guns were intended as their standard low-altitude anti-aircraft weapons the kerrison predictor was a relatively simple device compared to high-altitude predictors and was designed to meet these particular requirements inputs to its calculations included wind speed , ballistics of the gun and the rounds it fired , angle to the target in azimuth and altitude , and a user-input estimated target speed some of these inputs were fed in by dials , which turned gearing inside the predictor to calculate the range ( from the change in angle and estimated speed ) and direction of motion the kerrison predictor did not calculate fuse settings , as the shells fired by the 40 & nbsp ; mm bofors gun , with which it was designed to work , were contact-fused the no.7 anti-aircraft composite predictor , also designed by kerrison was similar in some ways although it was more accurate than the kerrison predictor , sperry was unable to keep up with production of its more expensive and complex m-7 director in december 1940 the singer corporation was contracted to produce 1,500 predictors per month to equip the army 's existing 37 & nbsp ; mm guns while production of the 40 & nbsp ; mm bofors was ramped up ( excerpt from ) with aircraft speeds increasing dramatically during the war , even the speed of the kerrison predictor proved lacking by the end nevertheless , the predictor demonstrated that effective gunnery required some sort of reasonably powerful computing support , and in 1944 bell labs started delivery of a new system based around an electronic analog computer

the cheek teeth are brachydont and bunodont in primitive genera , but hypsodont in later genera such as desmostylus , which has many supernumerary cusps their dental and skeletal forms suggest that desmostylians were aquatic herbivores dependent on littoral habitats their legs seemed to be adapted for terrestrial locomotion , while a number of other parameters confirms their aquatic nature : fossils have been found in marine strata based on a comparison of trunk and limb proportions , concluded that desmostylians were more terrestrial than aquatic and clearly fore limb-dominated swimmers , hence they were more similar to '' sea bears '' than '' sea sloths '' ( as proposed by other researchers ) however , a more recent and detailed analysis of desmostylian bone structure has revealed them to be fully aquatic , like sirenians and cetaceans , with their limbs being incapable of supporting their own weight on land desmostylian fossils are known from the northern pacific rim , from southern japan through russia , the aleutian islands , and the pacific coast of north america to the southern tip of baja california in particular , later species like neoparadoxia are more specialised than previous forms , suggesting increased divergence to compete with sirenians , and sirenian diversity appears to increase with desmostylian decline a major find was announced in october 2015 after scientists examined an extensive group of giant , tusked , quadruped , marine mammal fossils giant extinct mammal identified from unalaska fossils , alaska dispatch news , mike dunham , october 7 , 2015 photos : new species of extinct marine mammal identified from unalaska fossils , alaska dispatch news , mike dunham , october 7 , 2015

desmostylians were large , fully aquatic quadrupeds with massive limbs and short tails the cusps of the premolars and molars are composed of densely packed cylinders of thick enamel , giving the order its name ( '' bundle of columns '' ) their dental and skeletal forms suggest that desmostylians were aquatic herbivores dependent on littoral habitats their legs seemed to be adapted for terrestrial locomotion , while a number of other parameters confirms their aquatic nature : fossils have been found in marine strata ) however , a more recent and detailed analysis of desmostylian bone structure has revealed them to be fully aquatic , like sirenians and cetaceans , with their limbs being incapable of supporting their own weight on land more recent studies vindicate this assessment , as desmostylians had a thoracic morphology more similar to sirenians and modern cetaceans than to that of semiaquatic mammals a new genus and species of late miocene paleoparadoxiid ( mammalia , desmostylia ) from california giant extinct mammal identified from unalaska fossils , alaska dispatch news , mike dunham , october 7 , 2015 photos : new species of extinct marine mammal identified from unalaska fossils , alaska dispatch news , mike dunham , october 7 , 2015 douglas emlong 's 1971 discovery of the new genus behemotops from oregon showed that early desmostylians had more proboscidean-like teeth and jaws than later ones

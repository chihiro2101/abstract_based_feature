desmostylians were large , fully aquatic quadrupeds with massive limbs and short tails the smallest is ashoroa laticosta , a relatively large animal at a body length of 168 & nbsp ; cm , while the largest species reached sizes comparable to steller 's sea cow the cusps of the premolars and molars are composed of densely packed cylinders of thick enamel , giving the order its name ( '' bundle of columns '' ) ( this may reflect the close relationship between the paenungulata , to which this group has been assigned , and the tubulidentata their legs seemed to be adapted for terrestrial locomotion , while a number of other parameters confirms their aquatic nature : fossils have been found in marine strata the nares are retracted and the orbits are raised like in other aquatic mammals more recent studies vindicate this assessment , as desmostylians had a thoracic morphology more similar to sirenians and modern cetaceans than to that of semiaquatic mammals a 2017 study on desmostylus and paleoparadoxia shows that the former preferred areas shallower than 30 m , while the latter occurred in deep , offshore waters a new genus and species of late miocene paleoparadoxiid ( mammalia , desmostylia ) from california in 1926 , the austrian palaeontologist othenio abel suggested origins with monotremes , like the platypus , and in 1933 , he even created the order '' desmostyloidea '' , which he placed within the multituberculata

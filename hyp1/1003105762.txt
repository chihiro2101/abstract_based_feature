desmostylians were large , fully aquatic quadrupeds with massive limbs and short tails the cusps of the premolars and molars are composed of densely packed cylinders of thick enamel , giving the order its name ( '' bundle of columns '' ) the cheek teeth are brachydont and bunodont in primitive genera , but hypsodont in later genera such as desmostylus , which has many supernumerary cusps ( this may reflect the close relationship between the paenungulata , to which this group has been assigned , and the tubulidentata ) however , a more recent and detailed analysis of desmostylian bone structure has revealed them to be fully aquatic , like sirenians and cetaceans , with their limbs being incapable of supporting their own weight on land more recent studies vindicate this assessment , as desmostylians had a thoracic morphology more similar to sirenians and modern cetaceans than to that of semiaquatic mammals a new genus and species of late miocene paleoparadoxiid ( mammalia , desmostylia ) from california merriam , who concluded on the basis of the molar structure and repeated occurrence in marine beds that the animals had been aquatic , and were probably sirenian because desmostylians were originally known only from skull fragments , teeth , and bits of other bones , general agreement was that they had had flippers and a fin-like tail douglas emlong 's 1971 discovery of the new genus behemotops from oregon showed that early desmostylians had more proboscidean-like teeth and jaws than later ones

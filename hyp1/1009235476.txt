'' homophone '' derives from the greek homo- & nbsp ; ( ὁμο & 8209 ; ) , '' same '' , and phōnḗ ( φωνή ) , '' voice , utterance '' an example of this is seen in dylan thomas 's radio play under milk wood : '' the shops in mourning '' where mourning can be heard as mourning or morning in some accents , various sounds have merged in that they are no longer distinctive , and thus words that differ only by those sounds in an accent that maintains the distinction ( a minimal pair ) are homophonous in the accent with the merger some examples from english are : : pin and pen in many southern american english : the pairs do , due and forward , foreword are homophonous in most american accents but not in most english accents : the pairs talk , torque , and court , caught are distinguished in rhotic accents such as scottish english and most dialects of american english , but are homophones in many non-rhotic accents such as british received pronunciation wordplay is particularly common in english because the multiplicity of linguistic influences offers considerable complication in spelling and meaning and pronunciation compared with other languages same-sounding ( homophonous , or homophonic ) phrases are often used in various word games examples of same-sounding phrases ( which may only be true homophones in certain dialects of english ) include : : '' ice cream '' vs since the term oronym was already well established in linguistics as an onomastic designation for a class of toponymic features ( names of mountains , hills , etc there are sites , for example , this archived page , which have lists of homonyms or rather homophones and even 'multinyms ' which have as many as seven spellings there are differences in such lists due to dialect pronunciations and usage of old words as in other languages , however , there exists regional and/or individual variation in certain groups of words or in single words , so that the number of homophones varies accordingly of these , a few are triples like waagen ( weighing scales ) , wagen ( cart ) , wagen ( to dare ) and waise ( orphan ) – weise ( way , manner ) – weise ( wise ) yì , for example , has at least 125 homophones , and it is the pronunciation used for chinese characters such as 义 , 意 , 易 , 亿 , 议 , 一 , and 已 scholars also believe that old chinese had no phonemic tones , but tones emerged in middle chinese to replace sounds that were lost from old chinese since words in old chinese sounded more distinct from each other at this time , it explains why many words in classical chinese consisted of only one syllable pairs of words that are homophones in one dialect may not be homophones in the other for example , groan/grone and crane/crain are pseudo-homophone pairs , whereas plane/plain is a homophone pair since both letter strings are recognised words

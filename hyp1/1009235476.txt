'' homophone '' derives from the greek homo- & nbsp ; ( ὁμο & 8209 ; ) , '' same '' , and phōnḗ ( φωνή ) , '' voice , utterance '' homophones are often used to create puns and to deceive the reader ( as in crossword ) or to suggest multiple meanings an example of this is seen in dylan thomas 's radio play under milk wood : '' the shops in mourning '' where mourning can be heard as mourning or morning another vivid example is thomas hood 's use of '' birth '' and '' berth '' and '' told '' and '' toll 'd '' ( tolled ) in his poem '' faithless sally brown '' : : his death , which happen 'd in his berth , : at forty-odd befell : : they went and told the sexton , and : the sexton toll 'd the bell in some accents , various sounds have merged in that they are no longer distinctive , and thus words that differ only by those sounds in an accent that maintains the distinction ( a minimal pair ) are homophonous in the accent with the merger : merry , marry , and mary in most american accents : the pairs do , due and forward , foreword are homophonous in most american accents but not in most english accents wordplay is particularly common in english because the multiplicity of linguistic influences offers considerable complication in spelling and meaning and pronunciation compared with other languages same-sounding ( homophonous , or homophonic ) phrases are often used in various word games examples of same-sounding phrases ( which may only be true homophones in certain dialects of english ) include : : '' ice cream '' vs '' youth in asia '' : '' depend '' vs '' this guy '' ( most notably as a mondegreen in purple haze by jimi hendrix ) : '' four candles '' vs there are sites , for example , this archived page , which have lists of homonyms or rather homophones and even 'multinyms ' which have as many as seven spellings besides websites that offer extensive lists of german homophones , see , e.g see fausto cercignani , beispielsätze mit deutschen homophonen ( example sentences with german homophones ) for this reason , many one-syllable words from classical chinese became two-syllable words , like the words mentioned in the previous paragraph for example , the graphemes and digraphs '' d '' , '' gi '' , and '' r '' are all pronounced /z/ in the hanoi dialect , so the words dao ( knife ) , giao ( delivery ) , and rao ( advertise ) are all pronounced /zaw˧/ for example , groan/grone and crane/crain are pseudo-homophone pairs , whereas plane/plain is a homophone pair since both letter strings are recognised words reed 's homophones – a book of sound-alike words published in 2012 homophones.ml – a collection of homophones and their definitions homophone machine – swaps homophones in any sentence

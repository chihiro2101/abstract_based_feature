'' homophone '' derives from the greek homo- & nbsp ; ( ὁμο & 8209 ; ) , '' same '' , and phōnḗ ( φωνή ) , '' voice , utterance '' homophones are often used to create puns and to deceive the reader ( as in crossword ) or to suggest multiple meanings in some accents , various sounds have merged in that they are no longer distinctive , and thus words that differ only by those sounds in an accent that maintains the distinction ( a minimal pair ) are homophonous in the accent with the merger : the pairs talk , torque , and court , caught are distinguished in rhotic accents such as scottish english and most dialects of american english , but are homophones in many non-rhotic accents such as british received pronunciation wordplay is particularly common in english because the multiplicity of linguistic influences offers considerable complication in spelling and meaning and pronunciation compared with other languages same-sounding ( homophonous , or homophonic ) phrases are often used in various word games examples of same-sounding phrases ( which may only be true homophones in certain dialects of english ) include : : '' ice cream '' vs '' this guy '' ( most notably as a mondegreen in purple haze by jimi hendrix ) : '' four candles '' vs there are sites , for example , this archived page , which have lists of homonyms or rather homophones and even 'multinyms ' which have as many as seven spellings there are differences in such lists due to dialect pronunciations and usage of old words in english , there are approximately 88 triples ; 24 quadruples ; 2 quintuples ; 1 sextet and 1 septet there are many homophones in present-day standard german as in other languages , however , there exists regional and/or individual variation in certain groups of words or in single words , so that the number of homophones varies accordingly there are many homophones in japanese , due to the use of sino-japanese vocabulary , where borrowed words and morphemes from chinese are widely used in japanese , but many sound differences , such as the original words ' tones , are lost scholars also believe that old chinese had no phonemic tones , but tones emerged in middle chinese to replace sounds that were lost from old chinese since words in old chinese sounded more distinct from each other at this time , it explains why many words in classical chinese consisted of only one syllable for example , the graphemes and digraphs '' d '' , '' gi '' , and '' r '' are all pronounced /z/ in the hanoi dialect , so the words dao ( knife ) , giao ( delivery ) , and rao ( advertise ) are all pronounced /zaw˧/ for example , groan/grone and crane/crain are pseudo-homophone pairs , whereas plane/plain is a homophone pair since both letter strings are recognised words reed 's homophones – a book of sound-alike words published in 2012 homophones.ml – a collection of homophones and their definitions homophone machine – swaps homophones in any sentence

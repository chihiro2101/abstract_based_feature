the age of the site has been significantly refined over the last century from 1910 to 1945 , arthur posnansky maintained that the site was 11,000–17,000 years old based on comparisons to geological eras and archaeoastronomy beginning in the 1970s , carlos ponce sanginés proposed the site was first occupied around 1580 bc , the site 's oldest radiocarbon date since the 1980s , researchers have recognized this date as unreliable , leading to the consensus that the site is no older than 200 or 300 bc the structures that have been excavated by researchers at tiwanaku include the akapana , akapana east , and pumapunku stepped platforms , the kalasasaya , the kheri kala , and putin enclosures , and the semi-subterranean temple the akapana is an approximately cross-shaped pyramidal structure that is 257 m wide , 197 m broad at its maximum , and 16.5 m tall this was nearly destroyed by a deep looting excavation that extends from the center of this structure to its eastern side the largest stone block within the akapana , made of andesite , is estimated to weigh 65.7 tonnes the akapana east was built on the eastern side of early tiwanaku later it was considered a boundary between the ceremonial center and the urban area yellow and red clay was used in different areas for what seems like aesthetic purposes palaces of the ancient new world , dumbarton oaks research library and collection washington , d.c the pumapunku is a man-made platform built on an east-west axis like the akapana identical 20-meter-wide projections extend 27.6 meters north and south from the northeast and southeast corners of the pumapunku a prominent feature of the pumapunku is a large stone terrace ; it is 6.75 by 38.72 meters in dimension and paved with large stone blocks it is called the '' plataforma lítica '' and contains the largest stone block found in the tiwanaku site , 1999 , interpreting the meaning of ritual spaces : the temple complex of pumapunku , tiwanaku , bolivia , doctoral dissertation , university of pennsylvania since the late 20th century , researchers have theorized that this was not the gateway 's original location near the courtyard is the semi-subterranean temple ; a square sunken courtyard that is unique for its north-south rather than east-west axis 190 the largest stone block in the kalasasaya is estimated to weigh 26.95 metric tons like the later inca , the tiwanaku had few commercial or market institutions as the site has suffered from looting and amateur excavations since shortly after tiwanaku 's fall , archeologists must attempt to interpret it with the understanding that materials have been jumbled and destroyed german geologist alphons stübel spent nine days in tiwanaku in 1876 , creating a map of the site based on careful measurements evidence of similar types of cranial vault modification in burials between the omo site and the main site of tiwanaku is also being used for this argument recently , the department of archaeology of bolivia ( dinar , directed by javier escalante ) has been conducting excavations on the akapana pyramid

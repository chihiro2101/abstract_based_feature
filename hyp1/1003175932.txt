the age of the site has been significantly refined over the last century from 1910 to 1945 , arthur posnansky maintained that the site was 11,000–17,000 years old based on comparisons to geological eras and archaeoastronomy beginning in the 1970s , carlos ponce sanginés proposed the site was first occupied around 1580 bc , the site 's oldest radiocarbon date since the 1980s , researchers have recognized this date as unreliable , leading to the consensus that the site is no older than 200 or 300 bc most recently , a statistical assessment of reliable radiocarbon dates estimates that the site was founded around ad 110 ( 50–170 , 68 % probability ) , a date supported by the lack of ceramic styles from earlier periods the structures that have been excavated by researchers at tiwanaku include the akapana , akapana east , and pumapunku stepped platforms , the kalasasaya , the kheri kala , and putin enclosures , and the semi-subterranean temple this was nearly destroyed by a deep looting excavation that extends from the center of this structure to its eastern side a staircase with sculptures is present on its western side twenty-first-century studies have shown that it is an entirely manmade earthen mound , faced with a mixture of large and small stone blocks the dirt comprising akapana appears to have been excavated from the '' moat '' that surrounds the site the largest stone block within the akapana , made of andesite , is estimated to weigh 65.7 tonnes the akapana east was built on the eastern side of early tiwanaku it was made of a thick , prepared floor of sand and clay , which supported a group of buildings a prominent feature of the pumapunku is a large stone terrace ; it is 6.75 by 38.72 meters in dimension and paved with large stone blocks it is called the '' plataforma lítica '' and contains the largest stone block found in the tiwanaku site terrazas , 1970 , acerca de la procedencia del material lítico de los monumentos de tiwanaku , 1999 , interpreting the meaning of ritual spaces : the temple complex of pumapunku , tiwanaku , bolivia , doctoral dissertation , university of pennsylvania the second-largest stone block found within the pumapunku is estimated to be 85 metric tonnes near the courtyard is the semi-subterranean temple ; a square sunken courtyard that is unique for its north-south rather than east-west axis the walls are covered with tenon heads of many different styles , suggesting that the structure was reused for different purposes over time other damage was committed by people quarrying stone for building and railroad construction , and target practice by military personnel the ashlar blocks used in many of these structures were mass-produced in similar styles so that they could possibly be used for multiple purposes the reconstruction was not sufficiently based on research ; for instance , a new wall was built around kalasasaya evidence of similar types of cranial vault modification in burials between the omo site and the main site of tiwanaku is also being used for this argument these structures spanned over 411 hectares , and included a stone temple and about one hundred circular or rectangular structures of vast dimensions , which were possibly domestic units .

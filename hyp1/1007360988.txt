the type species is ancistrus cirrhosus the name ancistrus derives from the ancient greek agkistron '' hook '' & nbsp ; – a reference to the form of the cheek odontodes the feature most commonly associated with the genus are the fleshy tentacles found on the head in adult males ; females may possess tentacles along the snout margin but they are smaller and they lack tentacles on the head tentacules , tentacles directly associated with odontodes , develop on the pectoral fin spine of the males of some species males also have evertible cheek odontodes which are less developed or absent in females in comparison with a typical loricariid ( pleco ) , a bristlenose is typically shorter ( 4–6 inches or 15 & nbsp ; cm or less ) , more flattened and fatter with a comparatively wider head in contrast to many other loricariid 'plecos ' ( many of which regularly exceed a foot in captivity ) , the bristlenose plecos do not usually exceed six inches in length ; they can thus be kept in relatively small tanks , contributing to their popularity in the aquarium hobby ancistrus species are unusual among vertebrates in possessing an x0 sex-determination system , which is the prevailing method in many lineages of arthropod but is very rare elsewhere in the animal kingdom many species are found in the rivers and floodplain areas of the amazon basin , but there are also species elsewhere in tropical south america , as well as two species , a males may clean the inside of the cavity with their suckermouth before allowing the female to approach and inspect the nest the eggs hatch in 4–10 days over a period of 2–6 hours ; the male guards the eggs for 7–10 days after hatching females prefer males that are already protecting eggs and may prefer males that are protecting larvae ; it has been suggested that the tentacles may act as a fry mimic to attract females , which would allow males without eggs in their nest to compete with males guarding eggs historically , commonly available species of ancistrus were ancistrus cirrhosus and ancistrus temminckii ; other species are now available , though exact identification is difficult

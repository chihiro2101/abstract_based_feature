serious thought was given to improving the river from 1691 , but disagreements between groups from doncaster , rotherham and sheffield prevented progress the dutch river was difficult to navigate , and in 1793 , the stainforth and keadby canal was authorised , to provide a link from the don at stainforth to the trent at keadby although notionally independent , it was effectively under the control of the don navigation when it opened , probably in 1802 the dearne and dove canal was also authorised in 1793 , from swinton to barnsley , and was again under don navigation control , since most of the shareholders were also shareholders in the don a canal from tinsley into sheffield was delayed for years by opposition from the don navigation , but was authorised in 1815 and opened in 1819 they bought out the dearne and dove canal in 1846 , and acquired the sheffield canal from the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway in 1848 , which , as the sheffield and lincolnshire junction railway , a predecessor and constituent company , had bought it in 1846 after protracted negotiations , they absorbed the stainforth and keadby canal in 1849 they then amalgamated with the south yorkshire , doncaster and goole railway in 1850 , to become the south yorkshire railway and river dun company with the manchester ship canal under construction , and other large canals being proposed , a committee was formed to investigate a new canal from sheffield to the sea the estimated cost of this work , which included a new canal from tinsley to sheffield , but did not include buying the canals from the railway company , was put at £1 & nbsp ; million the sheffield and south yorkshire canal company limited was formed in november 1888 , with a capital of £30,000 , to promote this new venture and obtain the necessary act of parliament the intent was to rebuild the don and the stainforth and keadby routes to allow 300- or 400-ton barges to be used , and to develop coal-handling facilities at keadby so that it would rival goole on the aire and calder navigation in 1906 , the worsbrough branch ceased to be navigable , and became just a water feeder , and in 1909 , the company effectively conceded defeat , by allowing coal to be mined under the canal today the system is open to navigation throughout the main line , the stainforth and keadby and new junction canals , and is mostly used for leisure boating the rother link is a scheme that would see the river rother upgraded to navigable status from rotherham as far as killamarsh , where a short canal would link to the chesterfield canal to complete a leisure cruising circuit

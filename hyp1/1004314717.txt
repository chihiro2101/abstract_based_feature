the dearne and dove canal was also authorised in 1793 , from swinton to barnsley , and was again under don navigation control , since most of the shareholders were also shareholders in the don a canal from tinsley into sheffield was delayed for years by opposition from the don navigation , but was authorised in 1815 and opened in 1819 they bought out the dearne and dove canal in 1846 , and acquired the sheffield canal from the manchester , sheffield and lincolnshire railway in 1848 , which , as the sheffield and lincolnshire junction railway , a predecessor and constituent company , had bought it in 1846 they then amalgamated with the south yorkshire , doncaster and goole railway in 1850 , to become the south yorkshire railway and river dun company their report , presented in october 1888 , suggested that the existing locks on the route from sheffield to keadby were inadequate , but that the waterway could be upgraded to take 300- to 500-ton boats by building new locks alongside the old , without disrupting traffic the estimated cost of this work , which included a new canal from tinsley to sheffield , but did not include buying the canals from the railway company , was put at £1 & nbsp ; million the new company obtained an act of parliament on 26 august 1889 , creating the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation company , which was authorised to raise £1.5 & nbsp ; million and to purchase the four canals either by negotiation , or by compulsory purchase if after nine months negotiations with the railway company had failed to reach an agreement they could also improve the canals they bought , or build new ones , and could also act as inland carriers the intent was to rebuild the don and the stainforth and keadby routes to allow 300- or 400-ton barges to be used , and to develop coal-handling facilities at keadby so that it would rival goole on the aire and calder navigation in addition , the dearne and dove canal would be dredged , so that tom pudding , like those on the aire and calder , could be used for the transport of coal meanwhile , negotiations had also taken place with the aire and calder , and an agreement had been reached to connect the two systems together by a canal , so that the improved don could use goole for the export of coal , rather than having to develop keadby by 1893 , agreement had been reached as to what the railway company was selling , and a price of £1.14 & nbsp ; million had been fixed , of which £600,000 was to be paid in cash the rest could be paid in shares in the new company , which would give the railway places on the board unless the canal company bought all of the shares back while the company had hoped to have £1 & nbsp ; million to fund improvements , there was no working capital , and the enlargement of the locks to take 300- or 500-ton barges did not take place today the system is open to navigation throughout the main line , the stainforth and keadby and new junction canals , and is mostly used for leisure boating

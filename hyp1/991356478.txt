image : rochepotential.jpg thumb a three-dimensional representation of the roche potential in a binary star with a mass ratio of 2 , in the co-rotating frame the droplet-shaped figures in the equipotential plot at the bottom of the figure define what are considered the roche lobes of the stars mass can flow through the saddle point from one star to its companion , if the star fills its roche lobe the two together can be described by a potential , so that , for example , the stellar surfaces lie along equipotential surfaces close to each star , surfaces of equal gravitational potential are approximately sphere and concentric with the nearer star in the gravity potential graphics , l 1 , l 2 , l 3 , l 4 , l 5 are in synchronous rotation with the system it is a gravity cut-off point of the binary star system in principle , mass transfer could lead to the total disintegration of the object , since a reduction of the object 's mass causes its roche lobe to shrink such mass transfer by roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) is further broken down into three distinct cases : case a rlof occurs when the donor star is main sequence the case when the star that initially was the donor undergoes a supernova before the other star reaches a rlof phase the precise shape of the roche lobe depends on the mass ratio q m_ this formula gives results up to 1 % accuracy over the entire range of the mass ratio q .

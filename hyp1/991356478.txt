image : rochepotential.jpg thumb a three-dimensional representation of the roche potential in a binary star with a mass ratio of 2 , in the co-rotating frame the droplet-shaped figures in the equipotential plot at the bottom of the figure define what are considered the roche lobes of the stars mass can flow through the saddle point from one star to its companion , if the star fills its roche lobe close to each star , surfaces of equal gravitational potential are approximately sphere and concentric with the nearer star a critical equipotential intersects itself at the lagrangian point of the system , forming a two-lobed figure-of-eight with one of the two stars at the center of each lobe this is not derivable from the roche lobe model as the coriolis force is a non-conservative force ( i.e it is a gravity cut-off point of the binary star system when a star '' exceeds its roche lobe '' , its surface extends out beyond its roche lobe and the material which lies outside the roche lobe can '' fall off '' into the other object 's roche lobe via the first lagrangian point first , a reduction of the mass of the donor star may cause the donor star to shrink as well , possibly preventing such an outcome if the donor star expands less rapidly or shrinks faster than its roche lobe , mass transfer will generally be stable and may continue for a long time the case when the star that initially was the donor undergoes a supernova after the other star has undergone its own round of rlof case b happens when rlof starts while the donor is a post-core hydrogen burning/hydrogen shell burning star

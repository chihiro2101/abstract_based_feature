image : rochepotential.jpg thumb a three-dimensional representation of the roche potential in a binary star with a mass ratio of 2 , in the co-rotating frame mass can flow through the saddle point from one star to its companion , if the star fills its roche lobe source in a binary system with a circular orbit , it is often useful to describe the system in a coordinate system that rotates along with the objects close to each star , surfaces of equal gravitational potential are approximately sphere and concentric with the nearer star a critical equipotential intersects itself at the lagrangian point of the system , forming a two-lobed figure-of-eight with one of the two stars at the center of each lobe this is not derivable from the roche lobe model as the coriolis force is a non-conservative force ( i.e it is a gravity cut-off point of the binary star system when a star '' exceeds its roche lobe '' , its surface extends out beyond its roche lobe and the material which lies outside the roche lobe can '' fall off '' into the other object 's roche lobe via the first lagrangian point if the donor star expands less rapidly or shrinks faster than its roche lobe , mass transfer will generally be stable and may continue for a long time such mass transfer by roche lobe overflow ( rlof ) is further broken down into three distinct cases : the case when the star that initially was the donor undergoes a supernova before the other star reaches a rlof phase the precise shape of the roche lobe depends on the mass ratio q m_ this formula gives results up to 1 % accuracy over the entire range of the mass ratio q .

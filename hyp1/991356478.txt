image : rochepotential.jpg thumb a three-dimensional representation of the roche potential in a binary star with a mass ratio of 2 , in the co-rotating frame the droplet-shaped figures in the equipotential plot at the bottom of the figure define what are considered the roche lobes of the stars , and are the lagrangian points where forces ( considered in the rotating frame ) cancel out mass can flow through the saddle point from one star to its companion , if the star fills its roche lobe source in a binary system with a circular orbit , it is often useful to describe the system in a coordinate system that rotates along with the objects close to each star , surfaces of equal gravitational potential are approximately sphere and concentric with the nearer star a critical equipotential intersects itself at the lagrangian point of the system , forming a two-lobed figure-of-eight with one of the two stars at the center of each lobe this is not derivable from the roche lobe model as the coriolis force is a non-conservative force ( i.e in the gravity potential graphics , l 1 , l 2 , l 3 , l 4 , l 5 are in synchronous rotation with the system it is a gravity cut-off point of the binary star system when a star '' exceeds its roche lobe '' , its surface extends out beyond its roche lobe and the material which lies outside the roche lobe can '' fall off '' into the other object 's roche lobe via the first lagrangian point the expansion of the binary orbit will lead to a less dramatic shrinkage or even expansion of the donor 's roche lobe , often preventing the destruction of the donor

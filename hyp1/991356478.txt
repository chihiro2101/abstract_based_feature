image : rochepotential.jpg thumb a three-dimensional representation of the roche potential in a binary star with a mass ratio of 2 , in the co-rotating frame the droplet-shaped figures in the equipotential plot at the bottom of the figure define what are considered the roche lobes of the stars mass can flow through the saddle point from one star to its companion , if the star fills its roche lobe source in a binary system with a circular orbit , it is often useful to describe the system in a coordinate system that rotates along with the objects the two together can be described by a potential , so that , for example , the stellar surfaces lie along equipotential surfaces close to each star , surfaces of equal gravitational potential are approximately sphere and concentric with the nearer star passing through these two equilibrium points , debris can commute between the external region ( figure-eights of yellow and green in the outer side ) and the communal gravity region of the binary system if the mass ratio of the two stars becomes larger , then the orange , yellow and green regions will become a horseshoe orbit first , a reduction of the mass of the donor star may cause the donor star to shrink as well , possibly preventing such an outcome the donor star can shrink so small to stop mass transfer , but eventually mass transfer will start again as stellar evolution continues leading to the cases the case when the star that initially was the donor undergoes a supernova before the other star reaches a rlof phase the precise shape of the roche lobe depends on the mass ratio q m_ this formula gives results up to 1 % accuracy over the entire range of the mass ratio q .

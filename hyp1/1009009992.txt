what is a pattern ? when a designer designs something – whether a house , computer program , or lamp – they must make many decisions about how to solve problems each pattern has a name , a descriptive entry , and some cross-references , much like a dictionary entry a documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern 's contexts patterns might be invented or found and studied , such as the naturally occurring patterns of design that characterize human environments purplsoc 2015 proceedings , july 3-5 2015 krems , austria purplsoc meeting on the many open scientific questions , e.g regarding the theoretical background of patterns and the practical implementation of pattern methods in research and teaching like all languages , a pattern language has vocabulary , syntax , and grammar – but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication in pattern languages for design , the parts break down in this way : the language description – the vocabulary – is a collection of named , described solutions to problems in a field of interest in christopher alexander 's book a pattern language , the patterns are in decreasing order by size , with a separate alphabetic index this simplifies the design work because designers can start the process from any part of the problem they understand and work toward the unknown parts at the same time , if the pattern language has worked well for many projects , there is reason to believe that even a designer who does not completely understand the design problem at first will complete the design process , and the result will be usable just as words must have grammar and semantic relationships to each other in order to make a spoken language useful , design patterns must be related to each other in position and utility order to form a pattern language eventually all of the remaining design problems are small enough or routine enough to be solved by improvisation by the builders , and the '' design '' is done the most difficult part of having an outside expert apply a pattern language is in fact to get a reliable , complete list of the problems to be solved the desire to empower users of architecture was , in fact , what led alexander to undertake a pattern language project for architecture in the first place the idea expressed in a pattern should be general enough to be applied in very different systems within its context , but still specific enough to give constructive guidance however , even a very abstract pattern will usually contain examples that are , by nature , absolutely concrete and specific alexander gives each pattern a rating by zero , one or two stars , indicating how well they are proven in real-world examples a pattern must characterize the problems that it is meant to solve , the context or situation where these problems arise , and the conditions under which the proposed solutions can be recommended a pattern emerges as a dialogue that will then help to balance the forces and finally make a decision though quite unspecific in its context , the forces in the '' secondary activity '' pattern are very similar to those in '' wireless telephone '' in alexander 's book , such links are collected in the '' references '' part , and echoed in the linked pattern 's '' context '' part – thus the overall structure is a directed graph alexander draws a parallel to the hierarchy of a grammar – that is one argument for him to speak of a pattern language in such a case we would speak of a pattern catalogue rather than a pattern language the pattern language approach has been used to document expertise in diverse fields a recipe or other sequential set of steps to be followed , with only one correct path from start to finish , is also not a pattern language the solutions proposed in the book include suggestions ranging from how cities and towns should be structured to where windows should be placed in a room each pattern describes a problem that occurs over and over again in our environment , and then describes the core solution to that problem , in such a way that you can use the solution a million times over , without ever doing it the same way twice christopher alexander 's idea has been adopted in other disciplines , often much more heavily than the original pattern ( architecture ) as depicted in the book a pattern language since the late 1990s , pedagogical patterns have been used to document good practices in teaching

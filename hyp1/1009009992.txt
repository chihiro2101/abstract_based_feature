what is a pattern ? a documented pattern should explain why that solution is good in the pattern 's contexts patterns might be invented or found and studied , such as the naturally occurring patterns of design that characterize human environments guiding patterns of naturally occurring design : elements purplsoc 2015 proceedings , july 3-5 2015 krems , austria purplsoc meeting on the many open scientific questions , e.g regarding the theoretical background of patterns and the practical implementation of pattern methods in research and teaching like all languages , a pattern language has vocabulary , syntax , and grammar – but a pattern language applies to some complex activity other than communication in pattern languages for design , the parts break down in this way : the language description – the vocabulary – is a collection of named , described solutions to problems in a field of interest so , for example , the language for architecture describes items like : settlements , buildings , rooms , windows , latches , etc for example , rooms have ways to get light , and ways to get people in and out the solution includes grammar that describes how the solution solves a problem or produces a benefit in christopher alexander 's book a pattern language , the patterns are in decreasing order by size , with a separate alphabetic index the web of relationships in the index of the language provides many paths through the design process many patterns form a language in the language , therefore , each pattern has to indicate its relationships to other patterns and to the language as a whole this gives the designer using the language a great deal of guidance about the related problems that must be solved the desire to empower users of architecture was , in fact , what led alexander to undertake a pattern language project for architecture in the first place the idea expressed in a pattern should be general enough to be applied in very different systems within its context , but still specific enough to give constructive guidance the range of situations in which the problems and solutions addressed in a pattern apply is called its context however , even a very abstract pattern will usually contain examples that are , by nature , absolutely concrete and specific it is generally claimed that all patterns need at least some existing real-world examples alexander sees the low-scale artifacts as constructive elements of the large-scale world , so they can be connected to a hierarchic network a pattern must characterize the problems that it is meant to solve , the context or situation where these problems arise , and the conditions under which the proposed solutions can be recommended though quite unspecific in its context , the forces in the '' secondary activity '' pattern are very similar to those in '' wireless telephone '' thus , the competing forces can be seen as part of the essence of a design concept expressed in a pattern a pattern language , as conceived by alexander , contains links from one pattern to another , so when trying to apply one pattern in a project , a designer is pushed to other patterns that are considered helpful in its context alexander draws a parallel to the hierarchy of a grammar – that is one argument for him to speak of a pattern language alexander encouraged people who used his system to expand his language with patterns of their own the pattern language approach has been used to document expertise in diverse fields examples since the 1990s include software design patterns in software engineering and , more generally , architectural pattern ( computer science ) , as well as interaction design patterns the deck '' group works : a pattern language for bringing life to meetings and other gatherings '' was published in 2011

researchers trace the origins of the blade back to the domestic sickle and the prehistoric bent stick used for hunting and later in hand-to-hand combat similar implements have existed in several forms throughout the indian subcontinent and were used both as weapons and as tools , such as for sacrificial rituals the kukri came to be known to the western world when the east india company came into conflict with the growing gorkha kingdom , culminating in the gurkha war of 1814â€“1816 all gurkha troops are issued with two kukris , a service no.1 ( ceremonial ) and a service no.2 ( exercise ) ; in modern times members of the brigade of gurkhas receive training in its use the weapon gained fame in the gurkha war and its continued use through both world war i and world war ii enhanced its reputation among both allied troops and enemy forces elsewhere during the second world war , the kukri was purchased and used by other british , commonwealth and us troops training in india , including the chindits and merrill 's marauders the notion of the gurkha with his kukri carried on through to the falklands war to reduce weight while keeping strength , the blade might be hollow forged , or a fuller is created kukri blades usually have a notch ( karda , kauda , gaudi , kaura , or cho ) at the base of the blade the notch may also represent the teats of a cow , a reminder that the kukri should not be used to kill a cow , an animal revered and worshipped by hindus the traditional handle attachment in nepal is the partial tang , although the more modern versions have the stick tang which has become popular traditionally , the scabbard also holds two smaller blades : an unsharpened checkmark to burnish the blade , and another accessory blade called a karda the tang of the blade usually extends all the way through to the end of the handle ; the small portion of the tang that projects through the end of the handle are hammered flat to secure the blade kukri handles , usually made from hardwood or buffalo horn , are often fastened with a kind of tree sap called laha ( also known as '' himalayan epoxy '' ) in more modern kukri , handles of cast aluminium or brass are press-fitted to the tang ; as the hot metal cools it shrinks , locking onto the blade the wheel is made by hand from fine river sand bound by laha , the same adhesive used to affix the handle to the blade kukri scabbards are usually made of wood or metal with an animal skin or metal or wood covering the kukri is effective as a chopping weapon , due to its weight , and slashing weapon , because the curved shape creates a '' wedge '' effect which causes the blade to cut effectively and deeper while most famed from use in the military , the kukri is the most commonly used multipurpose tool in the fields and homes in nepal it can function as a smaller knife by using the narrower part of the blade , closest to the handle tang tail ( puchchar ) : last point of the kukri blade despite the classification of eastern and western , both styles of kukri appear to be used in all areas of nepal

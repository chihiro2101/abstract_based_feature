from 1936 to 1975 the history of the minox brand is essentially that of the minox subminiature camera from 1975 the minox name also became associated with other products , most notably the minox 35 & nbsp ; mm compact cameras produced from 1975 until 2004 minox was acquired by leica in 1996 , but a management buyout on 25 august 2001 left minox an independent company again right the original minox subminiature camera was invented by walter zapp in 1936 nixi nylander also coined the name '' minox '' and drew up the minox mouse logo j√ºrgens funded the original project but was not able to get support in estonia for production in the same time , vef had received patent protection on zapp 's inventions in at least 18 countries worldwide it did not surmount the popularity of 35 & nbsp ; mm cameras ( which were then referred to as '' miniature cameras '' ) , but did achieve a niche market ironically during world war ii production of the minox was put in jeopardy several times as latvia fell victim to invasion by the soviet union , then germany , and then by the soviets again in the meantime , zapp and his associates protected their interest in the product by searching for alternative production facilities in germany right right after world war ii , production of the minox ii began in 1948 at a new company , minox gmbh , in giessen/heuchelheim near wetzlar , west germany the camera continued to appeal to a luxury '' gadget '' market which broadened during the 1950s and early 1960s it also continued to see use as an espionage camera by both sides during the cold war limited editions of the camera were also produced in a variety of luxury finishes , such as gold plating the riga minox camera , along with the luxury finish postwar cameras , are now collector 's items there is also the fully electronic entry-level model , the ec , which has a very different internal design and has a fixed-focus lens the minox tlx camera was available until september 2014 interest in minox subminiature cameras is likely to increase as minox began manufacturing 8x11mm film in january 2015 the minox subminiature camera attracted the attention of intelligence agencies in america , britain and germany , and most of the eastern bloc ( east germany , romania ) due to its small size and macro focusing ability there is at least one document in the public record of 25 minox cameras purchased by the us office of strategic services intelligence organisation in 1942 the film is in strips 9.2 & nbsp ; mm wide , or less than one-quarter the size of 35 mm film , and unlike 35 & nbsp ; mm film , it has no sprocket holes from minox bl and c cameras onward the minox film cartridge holds 15 , 30 , or 36 exposures since the minox c ( the first camera released with the new minox lens ) every 8x11mm camera had a distinct edge code to identify the camera the reason was that commercial processors used minox enlargers as the minox lens replaced the complan , so the enlargers had to change lenses : minox ii enlargers were curved negative track and complan lenses , minox iii enlargers were straight negative track and minox lenses the early minox cameras from riga to minox b , bl and ax , were equipped with a mechanical shutter , while later model minox ( c , lx , ec , tlx ) cameras have an electromagnetic shutter complan lens and minox lens are unit focusing lens , focusing from 8 inches ( 20 & nbsp ; cm ) to infinity through precision gear linked to a focusing dial on top of the camera for riga minox to minox b , the film advances each time the camera is closed , regardless of whether a picture is taken or not until 1995 the minox 35 cameras were considered the smallest cameras for the standard 35 & nbsp ; mm film format mdc has a multicoated minoxar 35 & nbsp ; mm/2.8 lens , all other functions are identical to minox 35ml other minox 35 mm cameras using minox film in minox cassette , image size 8x11mm

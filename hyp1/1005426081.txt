annibale carracci was born in bologna , and in all likelihood was first apprenticed within his family this eclecticism was to become the defining trait of the artists of the baroque emilian or bolognese school in many early bolognese works by the carraccis , it is difficult to distinguish the individual contributions made by each for example , the frescoes on the story of jason for palazzo fava in bologna ( c 1583–84 ) are signed carracci , which suggests that they all contributed in 1585 , annibale completed an altarpiece of the baptism of christ for the church of santi gregorio e siro in bologna from 1589 to 1592 , the three carracci brothers completed the frescoes on the founding of rome for palazzo magnani in bologna by 1593 , annibale had completed an altarpiece , virgin on the throne with st john and st catherine , in collaboration with lucio massari his resurrection of christ also dates from 1593 during 1593–94 , all three carraccis were working on frescoes in palazzo sampieri in bologna on the other hand , while admitting caravaggio 's talents as a painter , bellori deplored his over-naturalistic style , if not his turbulent morals and persona painters were urged to depict the platonic ideal of beauty , not roman street-walkers contemporary patrons , such as marquess vincenzo giustiniani , found both applied showed excellence in maniera and modeling caravaggio almost never worked in fresco , regarded as the test of a great painter 's mettle on the other hand , carracci 's best works are in fresco this thematic choice suggests carracci may have been more rebellious relative to the often-solemn religious passion of caravaggio 's canvases it is instructive to compare carracci 's assumption see the more adept altarpiece at the prado ( paintings by annibale carracci while michelangelo could bend and contort the body into all the possible perspectives , carracci in the farnese frescoes had shown how it could dance on july 8 , 1595 , annibale completed the painting of saint roch giving alms , now in dresden gemäldegalerie 1602 ) , which reveals a striking economy in figure composition and a force and precision of gesture that influenced on poussin and through him , the language of gesture in painting it is not clear how much work annibale completed after finishing the major gallery in the palazzo farnese in 1606 , annibale signs a madonna of the bowl “ annibale carracci ( 1560–1609 ) robertson : the invention of annibale carracci ( studi della bibliotheca hertziana , 4 ) , milano , 2008

thumb modern mmus typically divide the virtual address space ( the range of addresses used by the processor ) into pages , each having a size which is a power of 2 , usually a few kilobytes , but they may be much larger the bottom bits of the address ( the offset within a page ) are left unchanged the upper address bits are the virtual page numbers most mmus use an in-memory table of items called a '' page table '' , containing one '' page table entry '' ( pte ) per page , to map virtual page numbers to physical page numbers in main memory an associative cache of ptes is called a translation lookaside buffer ( tlb ) and is used to avoid the necessity of accessing the main memory every time a virtual address is mapped other mmus may have a private array of memory or registers that hold a set of page table entries the physical page number is combined with the page offset to give the complete physical address sometimes , a pte prohibits access to a virtual page , perhaps because no physical random access memory has been allocated to that virtual page the operating system ( os ) then handles the situation , perhaps by trying to find a spare frame of ram and set up a new pte to map it to the requested virtual address typically , an operating system assigns each program its own virtual address space with virtual memory , a contiguous range of virtual addresses can be mapped to several non-contiguous blocks of physical memory ; this non-contiguous allocation is one of the benefits of paging the x86 architecture provided segmentation , rather than paging , in the 80286 , and provides both paging and segmentation in the 80386 and later processors ( although the use of segmentation is not available in 64-bit operation ) some systems , mainly older risc designs , trap into the os when a page translation is not found in the tlb ; s0 space : ( or system space ) which is global to all processes and stores operating system code and data , whether paged or not , including pagetables normally , this would be very wasteful when addresses are used at both ends of the possible range , but the page table for applications is itself stored in the kernel 's paged memory thus , there is effectively a two-level tree , allowing applications to have sparse memory layout without wasting a lot of space on unused page table entries the vax mmu is notable for lacking an accessed bit oses which implement paging must find some way to emulate the accessed bit if they are to operate efficiently typically , the os will periodically unmap pages so that page-not-present faults can be used to let the os set an accessed bit ptes include read/write access permission based on privilege , cacheability information , an nx bit , and a non-secure bit it has the unusual feature of storing accessed and dirty bits outside of the page table ( along with the four bit protection key for all s/360 processors ) starting in august , 1972 , the ibm system/370 has a similar mmu , although it initially supported only a 24-bit virtual address space rather than the 32-bit virtual address space of the system/360 model 67 it also stores the accessed and dirty bits outside the page table after a tlb miss , low-level firmware machine code ( here called palcode ) walks a three-level tree-structured page table a pfn stores the physical address without the page mask bits a tlb refill exception is generated when there are no entries in the tlb that match the mapped virtual address if a tlb exception occurs when processing a tlb exception , a double fault tlb exception , it is dispatched to its own exception handler mips32 and mips32r2 support 32 bits of virtual address space and up to 36 bits of physical address space the mmu consists of a context register , a segment map and a page map virtual addresses from the cpu are translated into intermediate addresses by the segment map , which in turn are translated into physical addresses by the page map the 4-bit context register can switch between 16 sections of the segment map under supervisor control , which allows 16 contexts to be mapped concurrently the bat registers can map linear chunks of memory as large as and are normally used by an os to map large portions of the address space for the os kernel 's own use then 24 bits from the segment register replace those four bits , producing a 52-bit address in all levels of the page table , the page table entry includes a nx bit bit first , in the mapping of virtual memory addresses , instead of needing an mmu , the mcp systems are descriptor-based

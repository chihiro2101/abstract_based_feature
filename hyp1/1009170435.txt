autochrome is an additive color '' mosaic screen plate '' process unlike ordinary black-and-white plates , the autochrome was loaded into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens so that the light passed through the mosaic filter layer before reaching the emulsion because of the light loss due to all the filtering , autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films , which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used and that it was not practical to photograph moving subjects at normal viewing distances , the light coming through the individual grains blended together in the eye , reconstructing the color of the light photographed through the filter grains to create the autochrome color filter mosaic , a thin glass plate was first coated with a transparent adhesive layer it was found that the application of extreme pressure would produce a mosaic that more efficiently transmitted light to the emulsion , because the grains would be flattened slightly , making them more transparent , and pressed into more intimate contact with each other , reducing wasted space between them as it was impractical to apply such pressure to the entire plate all at once , a steamroller approach was used which flattened only one very small area at a time the resulting finished plate was cut up into smaller plates of the desired size , which were packaged in boxes of four patent describes the process more generally : the grains can be orange , violet , and green , or red , yellow , and blue ( or '' any number of colors '' ) , optionally with black powder filling the gaps the lumiere autochrome : history , technology , and preservation los angeles : the getty conservation institute ( 2013 ) , p because the presence of the mosaic color screen made the finished autochrome image very dark overall , bright light and special viewing arrangements were needed for satisfactory results slide projectors , then known as magic lanterns and stereopticons , were a less common but especially effective display technique , more suitable for public exhibitions american annual of photography , 1931 , 45:69 more than a few surviving autochromes suffer from such '' tanning '' and conventional projection is not a recommended means of displaying these irreplaceable images today the resulting '' dream-like '' impressionist quality may have been one reason behind the enduring popularity of the medium even after more starkly realistic color processes had become available has an extensive collection of early colour photography , including louise ducos du hauron 's earliest autochrome images and materials used by the lumiere brothers there has been a revival of interest in the process by some , including a few groups in france working with original lumiere machinery and notes in physical arrangement , however , the bayer filter mosaic much more closely resembles the regular geometric pattern used in other color screen plates of the autochrome era , such as the paget and finlay plates file : nieuport 23 c.1.jpg an autochrome of a world war i nieuport 23 biplane fighter , circa 1917

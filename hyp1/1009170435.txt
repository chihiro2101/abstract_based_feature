autochrome is an additive color '' mosaic screen plate '' process the medium consists of a glass plate coated on one side with a random mosaic of microscopic grains of potato starch dyed red-orange , green , and blue-violet ( an unusual but functional variant of the standard red , green , and blue additive colors ) ; the grains of starch act as color filters unlike ordinary black-and-white plates , the autochrome was loaded into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens so that the light passed through the mosaic filter layer before reaching the emulsion because of the light loss due to all the filtering , autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films , which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used and that it was not practical to photograph moving subjects when the finished image was viewed by transmitted light , each bit of the silver image acted as a micro-filter , allowing more or less light to pass through the corresponding colored starch grain , recreating the original proportions of the three colors at normal viewing distances , the light coming through the individual grains blended together in the eye , reconstructing the color of the light photographed through the filter grains to create the autochrome color filter mosaic , a thin glass plate was first coated with a transparent adhesive layer the dyed starch grains were graded to between 5 and 10 micrometers in size and the three colors were thoroughly intermingled in proportions which made the mixture appear gray to the unaided eye because the presence of the mosaic color screen made the finished autochrome image very dark overall , bright light and special viewing arrangements were needed for satisfactory results larger , non-stereoscopic plates were most commonly displayed in a diascope , which was a folding case with the autochrome image and a ground glass diffuser fitted into an opening on one side , and a mirror framed into the other side the user would place the diascope near a window or other light source so that light passed through the diffuser and the autochrome , and the resulting back-lit , dark-surrounded image would be viewed in the mirror the use of a '' light box '' or similar highly diffused artificial light source for viewing autochromes , although now nearly universal , is unfortunate , as the heavy scattering of light within and among the several layers of coatings on the plate degrades the color saturation ” this term was first coined by john wood in his book the art of autochrome : the birth of colour photography ( iowa city : university of iowa press , 1993 ) and has subsequently become familiar terminology used in reference to autochrome images nevertheless , the lumière products had a devoted following , above all in france , and their use persisted long after modern color films had become available has an extensive collection of early colour photography , including louise ducos du hauron 's earliest autochrome images and materials used by the lumiere brothers the 2006 film the illusionist tried to recreate the look of autochrome , although apparently basing that '' look '' on published reproductions rather than on actual autochrome plates modern image sensors in digital cameras most commonly use a bayer filter , which works in essentially the same way as the colored starch grains in an autochrome plate—by breaking up the image into microscopically small color-filtered elements in physical arrangement , however , the bayer filter mosaic much more closely resembles the regular geometric pattern used in other color screen plates of the autochrome era , such as the paget and finlay plates jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) file : autochrome box - reverse side.jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) - reverse side , featuring different languages file : original autochrome instruction manual - front cover ( scan )

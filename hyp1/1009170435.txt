autochrome is an additive color '' mosaic screen plate '' process the medium consists of a glass plate coated on one side with a random mosaic of microscopic grains of potato starch dyed red-orange , green , and blue-violet ( an unusual but functional variant of the standard red , green , and blue additive colors ) ; the grains of starch act as color filters lampblack fills the spaces between grains , and a black-and-white panchromatic silver halide emulsion is coated on top of the filter layer unlike ordinary black-and-white plates , the autochrome was loaded into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens so that the light passed through the mosaic filter layer before reaching the emulsion the use of an additional special orange-yellow filter in the camera was required to block ultraviolet light and restrain the effects of violet and blue light , parts of the spectrum to which the emulsion was overly sensitive because of the light loss due to all the filtering , autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films , which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used and that it was not practical to photograph moving subjects the luminance filter ( silver halide layer ) and the mosaic chrominance filter ( the colored potato starch grain layer ) remained precisely aligned and were distributed together , so that light was filtered in situ when the finished image was viewed by transmitted light , each bit of the silver image acted as a micro-filter , allowing more or less light to pass through the corresponding colored starch grain , recreating the original proportions of the three colors at normal viewing distances , the light coming through the individual grains blended together in the eye , reconstructing the color of the light photographed through the filter grains to create the autochrome color filter mosaic , a thin glass plate was first coated with a transparent adhesive layer it was found that the application of extreme pressure would produce a mosaic that more efficiently transmitted light to the emulsion , because the grains would be flattened slightly , making them more transparent , and pressed into more intimate contact with each other , reducing wasted space between them because the presence of the mosaic color screen made the finished autochrome image very dark overall , bright light and special viewing arrangements were needed for satisfactory results larger , non-stereoscopic plates were most commonly displayed in a diascope , which was a folding case with the autochrome image and a ground glass diffuser fitted into an opening on one side , and a mirror framed into the other side the user would place the diascope near a window or other light source so that light passed through the diffuser and the autochrome , and the resulting back-lit , dark-surrounded image would be viewed in the mirror , using condenser lenses for illumination , with a viewing lens in place of the projection lens ) , employing daylight ( not direct sunlight ) for the light source , can produce comparably excellent visual results—although for only one viewer at a time—without the unacceptable hazards of actual projection the use of a '' light box '' or similar highly diffused artificial light source for viewing autochromes , although now nearly universal , is unfortunate , as the heavy scattering of light within and among the several layers of coatings on the plate degrades the color saturation making modern film or digital copies of autochromes introduces other problems , because a color system based on red , green , and blue is used to copy an image that exists within the red-orange , green , and blue-violet system , providing further opportunities for color degradation modern image sensors in digital cameras most commonly use a bayer filter , which works in essentially the same way as the colored starch grains in an autochrome plate—by breaking up the image into microscopically small color-filtered elements jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) file : autochrome box - reverse side.jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) - reverse side , featuring different languages file : original autochrome instruction manual - front cover ( scan )

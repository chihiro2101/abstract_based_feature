autochrome is an additive color '' mosaic screen plate '' process the medium consists of a glass plate coated on one side with a random mosaic of microscopic grains of potato starch dyed red-orange , green , and blue-violet ( an unusual but functional variant of the standard red , green , and blue additive colors ) ; the grains of starch act as color filters unlike ordinary black-and-white plates , the autochrome was loaded into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens so that the light passed through the mosaic filter layer before reaching the emulsion because of the light loss due to all the filtering , autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films , which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used and that it was not practical to photograph moving subjects the plate was reversal-processed into a positive transparency — that is , the plate was first developed into a negative image but not '' fixed '' , then the silver forming the negative image was chemically removed , then the remaining silver halide was exposed to light and developed , producing a positive image when the finished image was viewed by transmitted light , each bit of the silver image acted as a micro-filter , allowing more or less light to pass through the corresponding colored starch grain , recreating the original proportions of the three colors to create the autochrome color filter mosaic , a thin glass plate was first coated with a transparent adhesive layer the dyed starch grains were graded to between 5 and 10 micrometers in size and the three colors were thoroughly intermingled in proportions which made the mixture appear gray to the unaided eye it was found that the application of extreme pressure would produce a mosaic that more efficiently transmitted light to the emulsion , because the grains would be flattened slightly , making them more transparent , and pressed into more intimate contact with each other , reducing wasted space between them experimentations within the early twentieth century provided solutions to many issues , including the addition of screen plates , a yellow filter designed to balance the blue , and adjustments to the size of the silver halide crystals to allow for a broader spectrum of colour and control over the frequency of light the lumiere autochrome : history , technology , and preservation because the presence of the mosaic color screen made the finished autochrome image very dark overall , bright light and special viewing arrangements were needed for satisfactory results stereoscope autochromes were especially popular , the combined color and depth proving to be a bewitching experience to early 20th century eyes the use of a '' light box '' or similar highly diffused artificial light source for viewing autochromes , although now nearly universal , is unfortunate , as the heavy scattering of light within and among the several layers of coatings on the plate degrades the color saturation ” this term was first coined by john wood in his book the art of autochrome : the birth of colour photography ( iowa city : university of iowa press , 1993 ) and has subsequently become familiar terminology used in reference to autochrome images has an extensive collection of early colour photography , including louise ducos du hauron 's earliest autochrome images and materials used by the lumiere brothers the royal horticultural society , uk has among the earliest colour photographs of plants and gardens taken by amateur photographer william van sommer ( 1859 - 1941 ) , including of rhs garden wisley taken around 1913 jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) file : autochrome box - reverse side.jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) - reverse side , featuring different languages file : original autochrome instruction manual - front cover ( scan ) jpg original autochrome instruction manual - front cover ( scan ) file : autochrome price list pamphlet - front ( scan )

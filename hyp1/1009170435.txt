autochrome is an additive color '' mosaic screen plate '' process unlike ordinary black-and-white plates , the autochrome was loaded into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens so that the light passed through the mosaic filter layer before reaching the emulsion because of the light loss due to all the filtering , autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films , which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used and that it was not practical to photograph moving subjects the plate was reversal-processed into a positive transparency — that is , the plate was first developed into a negative image but not '' fixed '' , then the silver forming the negative image was chemically removed , then the remaining silver halide was exposed to light and developed , producing a positive image the luminance filter ( silver halide layer ) and the mosaic chrominance filter ( the colored potato starch grain layer ) remained precisely aligned and were distributed together , so that light was filtered in situ when the finished image was viewed by transmitted light , each bit of the silver image acted as a micro-filter , allowing more or less light to pass through the corresponding colored starch grain , recreating the original proportions of the three colors at normal viewing distances , the light coming through the individual grains blended together in the eye , reconstructing the color of the light photographed through the filter grains to create the autochrome color filter mosaic , a thin glass plate was first coated with a transparent adhesive layer they were then spread onto the adhesive , creating a layer with approximately 4,000,000 grains per square inch but only one grain thick the plate was then coated with shellac to protect the moisture-vulnerable grains and dyes from the water-based gelatin emulsion , which was coated onto the plate after the shellac had dried experimentations within the early twentieth century provided solutions to many issues , including the addition of screen plates , a yellow filter designed to balance the blue , and adjustments to the size of the silver halide crystals to allow for a broader spectrum of colour and control over the frequency of light because the presence of the mosaic color screen made the finished autochrome image very dark overall , bright light and special viewing arrangements were needed for satisfactory results , using condenser lenses for illumination , with a viewing lens in place of the projection lens ) , employing daylight ( not direct sunlight ) for the light source , can produce comparably excellent visual results—although for only one viewer at a time—without the unacceptable hazards of actual projection the use of a '' light box '' or similar highly diffused artificial light source for viewing autochromes , although now nearly universal , is unfortunate , as the heavy scattering of light within and among the several layers of coatings on the plate degrades the color saturation ” this term was first coined by john wood in his book the art of autochrome : the birth of colour photography ( iowa city : university of iowa press , 1993 ) and has subsequently become familiar terminology used in reference to autochrome images library of congress 's huge collection of american pictorialist photographer arnold genthe 's work , 384 of his autochrome plates were among the holdings as of 1955 has an extensive collection of early colour photography , including louise ducos du hauron 's earliest autochrome images and materials used by the lumiere brothers modern image sensors in digital cameras most commonly use a bayer filter , which works in essentially the same way as the colored starch grains in an autochrome plate—by breaking up the image into microscopically small color-filtered elements file : genthe nude edit.jpg autochrome nude study by arnold genthe file : unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 )

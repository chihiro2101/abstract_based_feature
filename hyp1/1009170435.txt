autochrome is an additive color '' mosaic screen plate '' process the medium consists of a glass plate coated on one side with a random mosaic of microscopic grains of potato starch dyed red-orange , green , and blue-violet ( an unusual but functional variant of the standard red , green , and blue additive colors ) ; the grains of starch act as color filters lampblack fills the spaces between grains , and a black-and-white panchromatic silver halide emulsion is coated on top of the filter layer unlike ordinary black-and-white plates , the autochrome was loaded into the camera with the bare glass side facing the lens so that the light passed through the mosaic filter layer before reaching the emulsion the use of an additional special orange-yellow filter in the camera was required to block ultraviolet light and restrain the effects of violet and blue light , parts of the spectrum to which the emulsion was overly sensitive because of the light loss due to all the filtering , autochrome plates required much longer exposures than black-and-white plates and films , which meant that a tripod or other stand had to be used and that it was not practical to photograph moving subjects the luminance filter ( silver halide layer ) and the mosaic chrominance filter ( the colored potato starch grain layer ) remained precisely aligned and were distributed together , so that light was filtered in situ at normal viewing distances , the light coming through the individual grains blended together in the eye , reconstructing the color of the light photographed through the filter grains to create the autochrome color filter mosaic , a thin glass plate was first coated with a transparent adhesive layer patent describes the process more generally : the grains can be orange , violet , and green , or red , yellow , and blue ( or '' any number of colors '' ) , optionally with black powder filling the gaps experimentations within the early twentieth century provided solutions to many issues , including the addition of screen plates , a yellow filter designed to balance the blue , and adjustments to the size of the silver halide crystals to allow for a broader spectrum of colour and control over the frequency of light because the presence of the mosaic color screen made the finished autochrome image very dark overall , bright light and special viewing arrangements were needed for satisfactory results the slight pinkish tinge caused by colloidal scattering ( the effect seen through a glass of water into which a couple of drops of milk have been mixed ) is exacerbated , and the use of artificial light—especially fluorescent light—upsets the color rendition of a system which the lumière brothers carefully balanced for use with natural daylight making modern film or digital copies of autochromes introduces other problems , because a color system based on red , green , and blue is used to copy an image that exists within the red-orange , green , and blue-violet system , providing further opportunities for color degradation ” this term was first coined by john wood in his book the art of autochrome : the birth of colour photography ( iowa city : university of iowa press , 1993 ) and has subsequently become familiar terminology used in reference to autochrome images has an extensive collection of early colour photography , including louise ducos du hauron 's earliest autochrome images and materials used by the lumiere brothers in physical arrangement , however , the bayer filter mosaic much more closely resembles the regular geometric pattern used in other color screen plates of the autochrome era , such as the paget and finlay plates jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) file : autochrome box - reverse side.jpg original , unused box of autochrome plates ( 1921 ) - reverse side , featuring different languages file : original autochrome instruction manual - front cover ( scan ) jpg autochrome price list pamphlet - front ( scan ) file : autochrome price list pamphlet - reverse ( scan )

the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the aire continues to flow eastwards to bank dole junction , then continues in a north-easterly direction to haddlesey , from where it follows a winding course to join the river ouse at airmyn the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river instead , the selby canal flows northwards from haddlesey to the ouse at selby below dole bank junction , the knottingley and goole canal flows eastwards to join the ouse at goole the aire and calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking leeds and wakefield with york and the humber ( and thence the trent ) , although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly beyond leeds , the leeds and liverpool canal carries boats over the pennines the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation , which can be reached via the new junction canal , forms a link with doncaster , rotherham and sheffield to the south west , and the tidal river trent at keadby to the east in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point william pickering , who was mayor of leeds , had made further attempts to obtain an act of parliament for improvements to the river in 1679 , again without success although the bill had a lot of support , it was opposed by the city of york , who feared that the river ouse would be damaged by the scheme it named 18 undertakers , nine from the corporation of leeds , and nine '' gentlemen of wakefield '' , who would oversee the improvements to the river aire ( from the river ouse at airmyn via castleford to leeds ) and the river calder ( from castleford to wakefield ) regular dividends at 7 per cent were paid to the shareholders from 1718 , and the navigation was leased to various groups , who would be responsible for collection of tolls and repairs in 1744 , the undertakers bought some land at airmyn , and developed warehousing and wharfage there , as a more convenient point than rawcliffe , where the water was shallower there was a long-running dispute with arthur ingram , who owned knottingley mill , which started in 1731 , and was not finally resolved until 1776 , when the company bought both of ingram 's mills the recently finished calder and hebble navigation proposed to build a canal from wakefield to the dutch river , which would bypass the calder completely , and the leeds and liverpool canal supported a leeds to selby canal , which would bypass the aire during 1772 , they asked smeaton to survey a route to avoid the lower aire , but his assistant , william jessop actually carried out the work with parliament not reaching a decision , they reworked their plan , which was now for a canal from haddlesey to selby , with a new cut from ferrybridge to beal , and improvements above castleford in 1774 the leeds to selby bill was rejected by parliament , but the aire and calder bill was passed , aire and calder navigation act 1774 ( 14 geo in 1817 , there was a proposal for an aire and don canal , to connect knottingley to the dutch river at newbridge , with a branch to doncaster , and another for a went and wakefield canal , to connect cold hiendley on the barnsley canal to newbridge on the don in july 1821 , rennie proposed the construction of docks at goole , rather than a lock into the river , and the company proposed that of water should be available the new section was long , with locks at ferrybridge , whitley , pollington and goole faced with yet another outside scheme which would bypass the navigation from wakefield to ferrybridge , the company looked at improvements which would give of water all the way to both leeds and wakefield in 1905 , the new junction canal connected the aire and calder to the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation near stainforth the trains were filled with coal using canalside chutes at the colliery and pushed to the power station , where a hoist lifted each pan from the canal and upturned it to drop its contents onto a conveyor belt with the possible restoration of the barnsley canal and the dearne and dove canal , the section between wakefield and the new junction canal might become part of a new '' yorkshire ring ''

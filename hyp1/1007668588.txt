the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the aire continues to flow eastwards to bank dole junction , then continues in a north-easterly direction to haddlesey , from where it follows a winding course to join the river ouse at airmyn the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river below dole bank junction , the knottingley and goole canal flows eastwards to join the ouse at goole the aire and calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking leeds and wakefield with york and the humber ( and thence the trent ) , although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly more recent canals now also make the navigation a vital link in the english and welsh connected inland waterway network the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal the selby canal connects to the ouse , from where boats can travel upstream to reach york , boroughbridge and ripon , or downstream to the river derwent beyond goole are the humber and hence hull , immingham , and the north sea the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation , which can be reached via the new junction canal , forms a link with doncaster , rotherham and sheffield to the south west , and the tidal river trent at keadby to the east in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point it named 18 undertakers , nine from the corporation of leeds , and nine '' gentlemen of wakefield '' , who would oversee the improvements to the river aire ( from the river ouse at airmyn via castleford to leeds ) and the river calder ( from castleford to wakefield ) john hadley was engaged as the engineer immediately , and by 1704 the original work was completed , including 12 locks on the aire between haddesley and leeds and 4 on the calder in the 1760s , Â£13,000 was spent on improvements and maintenance , with several weirs being rebuilt to improve the depth of water he proposed a canal from haddlesey lock to the ouse at newland with parliament not reaching a decision , they reworked their plan , which was now for a canal from haddlesey to selby , with a new cut from ferrybridge to beal , and improvements above castleford in 1774 the leeds to selby bill was rejected by parliament , but the aire and calder bill was passed , aire and calder navigation act 1774 ( 14 geo canal boats were limited to about 60 tons , whereas ships of up to 200 tons could reach selby in 1817 , there was a proposal for an aire and don canal , to connect knottingley to the dutch river at newbridge , with a branch to doncaster , and another for a went and wakefield canal , to connect cold hiendley on the barnsley canal to newbridge on the don the destination was then changed to goole , and john rennie was asked to survey the route those opposing the scheme were placated by a clause which ensured the aire to airmyn and the selby canal would be maintained in july 1821 , rennie proposed the construction of docks at goole , rather than a lock into the river , and the company proposed that of water should be available a barge lock , and a ship lock , , capable of taking vessels up to 400 tons , connected the extensive docks to the ouse the new section was long , with locks at ferrybridge , whitley , pollington and goole work started on a new cut at castleford and on the line to leeds , but legal action over the selby canal meant that it had to be made deeper and wider in 1832 and 1833 in 1905 , the new junction canal connected the aire and calder to the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation near stainforth it was funded by the aire and calder , with the don navigation eventually meeting half the cost

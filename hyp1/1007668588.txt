the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river instead , the selby canal flows northwards from haddlesey to the ouse at selby below dole bank junction , the knottingley and goole canal flows eastwards to join the ouse at goole from just before newbridge , where the modern a614 road crosses the waterway , this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the dutch river , an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by cornelius vermuyden 's original diversion of the river don northwards to the river aire in 1628 the aire and calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking leeds and wakefield with york and the humber ( and thence the trent ) , although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly more recent canals now also make the navigation a vital link in the english and welsh connected inland waterway network the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal the selby canal connects to the ouse , from where boats can travel upstream to reach york , boroughbridge and ripon , or downstream to the river derwent the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation , which can be reached via the new junction canal , forms a link with doncaster , rotherham and sheffield to the south west , and the tidal river trent at keadby to the east in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point william pickering , who was mayor of leeds , had made further attempts to obtain an act of parliament for improvements to the river in 1679 , again without success john hadley was engaged as the engineer immediately , and by 1704 the original work was completed , including 12 locks on the aire between haddesley and leeds and 4 on the calder during 1772 , they asked smeaton to survey a route to avoid the lower aire , but his assistant , william jessop actually carried out the work in 1774 the leeds to selby bill was rejected by parliament , but the aire and calder bill was passed , aire and calder navigation act 1774 ( 14 geo selby was the upper limit for seagoing ships at the time , and became a major transhipment port for the smaller boats using the canal canal boats were limited to about 60 tons , whereas ships of up to 200 tons could reach selby with revenue from tolls reaching £82,092 in 1818 , which enabled a dividend of £54,000 to be paid , the company was in a healthy state , and proposed their own route from haddlesey to the dutch river those opposing the scheme were placated by a clause which ensured the aire to airmyn and the selby canal would be maintained in july 1821 , rennie proposed the construction of docks at goole , rather than a lock into the river , and the company proposed that of water should be available a barge lock , and a ship lock , , capable of taking vessels up to 400 tons , connected the extensive docks to the ouse the new section was long , with locks at ferrybridge , whitley , pollington and goole the connection to the aire and the selby canal was maintained by the lock at bank dole in 1880 they carried 151,860 tons , and by 1913 there were 18 tugs , 1,010 compartments , and 1,560,006 tons were carried , 33 times warde-aldam 's original estimate in 1905 , the new junction canal connected the aire and calder to the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation near stainforth most of the commercial traffic using the navigation now consists of petroleum tankers and gravel barges with the possible restoration of the barnsley canal and the dearne and dove canal , the section between wakefield and the new junction canal might become part of a new '' yorkshire ring ''

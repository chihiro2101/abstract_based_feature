the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the aire continues to flow eastwards to bank dole junction , then continues in a north-easterly direction to haddlesey , from where it follows a winding course to join the river ouse at airmyn the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river below dole bank junction , the knottingley and goole canal flows eastwards to join the ouse at goole from just before newbridge , where the modern a614 road crosses the waterway , this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the dutch river , an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by cornelius vermuyden 's original diversion of the river don northwards to the river aire in 1628 the aire and calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking leeds and wakefield with york and the humber ( and thence the trent ) , although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly more recent canals now also make the navigation a vital link in the english and welsh connected inland waterway network the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation , which can be reached via the new junction canal , forms a link with doncaster , rotherham and sheffield to the south west , and the tidal river trent at keadby to the east in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point it named 18 undertakers , nine from the corporation of leeds , and nine '' gentlemen of wakefield '' , who would oversee the improvements to the river aire ( from the river ouse at airmyn via castleford to leeds ) and the river calder ( from castleford to wakefield ) john hadley was engaged as the engineer immediately , and by 1704 the original work was completed , including 12 locks on the aire between haddesley and leeds and 4 on the calder the locks were long by wide with depths over the sills they asked john smeaton to suggest improvements in 1771 , but the subsequent attempt to authorise such improvements was disputed in parliament on the basis that the present navigation was totally inadequate the recently finished calder and hebble navigation proposed to build a canal from wakefield to the dutch river , which would bypass the calder completely , and the leeds and liverpool canal supported a leeds to selby canal , which would bypass the aire with parliament not reaching a decision , they reworked their plan , which was now for a canal from haddlesey to selby , with a new cut from ferrybridge to beal , and improvements above castleford in 1774 the leeds to selby bill was rejected by parliament , but the aire and calder bill was passed , aire and calder navigation act 1774 ( 14 geo all locks were replaced , and the total cost was over £60,000 , of which around £20,000 was for the selby canal the navigation remained profitable , paying £9,000 in dividends in 1775 , which had risen to £32,000 by 1791 selby was the upper limit for seagoing ships at the time , and became a major transhipment port for the smaller boats using the canal canal boats were limited to about 60 tons , whereas ships of up to 200 tons could reach selby with revenue from tolls reaching £82,092 in 1818 , which enabled a dividend of £54,000 to be paid , the company was in a healthy state , and proposed their own route from haddlesey to the dutch river those opposing the scheme were placated by a clause which ensured the aire to airmyn and the selby canal would be maintained construction at goole started on 28 september 1822 , and the company eventually built much of the new town as well as the docks in 1905 , the new junction canal connected the aire and calder to the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation near stainforth between wakefield and leeds , via castleford , the navigation is part of a circular cruising route or '' ring '' , formed by the leeds & liverpool and the huddersfield or rochdale canals with the possible restoration of the barnsley canal and the dearne and dove canal , the section between wakefield and the new junction canal might become part of a new '' yorkshire ring ''

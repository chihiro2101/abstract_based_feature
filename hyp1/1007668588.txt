the aire and calder is a canalisation of the river calder from wakefield to castleford , where it joins the branch from leeds , which follows the river aire the section below haddlesey is no longer part of the navigation , as a derelict lock blocks access to the lower river below dole bank junction , the knottingley and goole canal flows eastwards to join the ouse at goole from just before newbridge , where the modern a614 road crosses the waterway , this branch of the navigation runs parallel to the dutch river , an artificial channel built in 1635 to alleviate flooding caused by cornelius vermuyden 's original diversion of the river don northwards to the river aire in 1628 the aire and calder still fulfils its original purpose of linking leeds and wakefield with york and the humber ( and thence the trent ) , although the routes by which this is achieved have changed significantly beyond leeds , the leeds and liverpool canal carries boats over the pennines the calder and hebble navigation , which connects to the navigation at wakefield , allows boats to reach the huddersfield broad and narrow canals , and the rochdale canal the selby canal connects to the ouse , from where boats can travel upstream to reach york , boroughbridge and ripon , or downstream to the river derwent the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation , which can be reached via the new junction canal , forms a link with doncaster , rotherham and sheffield to the south west , and the tidal river trent at keadby to the east in the early 1600s , the river aire was navigable to knottingley , and boats carrying up to 30 & nbsp ; tons traded on the river , which was tidal up to this point william pickering , who was mayor of leeds , had made further attempts to obtain an act of parliament for improvements to the river in 1679 , again without success as the 1600s drew to a close , a number of bills were passed for other rivers , and there was general support for river navigations john hadley surveyed the aire , and samuel shelton surveyed the calder it named 18 undertakers , nine from the corporation of leeds , and nine '' gentlemen of wakefield '' , who would oversee the improvements to the river aire ( from the river ouse at airmyn via castleford to leeds ) and the river calder ( from castleford to wakefield ) some development of the navigation occurred the recently finished calder and hebble navigation proposed to build a canal from wakefield to the dutch river , which would bypass the calder completely , and the leeds and liverpool canal supported a leeds to selby canal , which would bypass the aire all locks were replaced , and the total cost was over £60,000 , of which around £20,000 was for the selby canal in 1817 , there was a proposal for an aire and don canal , to connect knottingley to the dutch river at newbridge , with a branch to doncaster , and another for a went and wakefield canal , to connect cold hiendley on the barnsley canal to newbridge on the don in july 1821 , rennie proposed the construction of docks at goole , rather than a lock into the river , and the company proposed that of water should be available rennie died in late 1821 , and george leather took over as engineer faced with yet another outside scheme which would bypass the navigation from wakefield to ferrybridge , the company looked at improvements which would give of water all the way to both leeds and wakefield it included a clause to ensure that the selby canal was maintained with a depth of water of , and made provision for extensions to goole docks the leeds line was completed in april 1835 , somewhat later than anticipated , as the banks were made more substantial , to cope with steam tugs , which would be introduced in due course warde-aldam thought that such a system could carry 45,000 tons of coal per year , and £13,382 was allocated for three train boats , a hoist , and hydraulic machinery to control the hoist and the lock into the docks in 1905 , the new junction canal connected the aire and calder to the sheffield and south yorkshire navigation near stainforth the eastern part of the navigation , sometimes known as the knottingley and goole canal , is rather different : it has long straight stretches , but mainly through flat land that has always been agricultural with the possible restoration of the barnsley canal and the dearne and dove canal , the section between wakefield and the new junction canal might become part of a new '' yorkshire ring ''

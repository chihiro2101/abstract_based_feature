in some languages , in addition to such singular and plural forms , there is also a dual form , which is used when exactly two people or things are meant in many languages with dual forms , the use of the dual is mandatory as in some arabic dialects using dual in nouns as in hejazi arabic , and the plural is used only for groups greater than two however , the use of the dual is optional in some languages such as other modern arabic dialects including egyptian arabic in other languages such as hebrew , the dual exists only for words naming time spans ( day , week , etc although relatively few languages have the dual number , using different words for groups of two and groups greater than two is not uncommon among living languages , modern standard arabic has a mandatory dual number , marked on nouns , verbs , adjectives and pronouns ( first-person dual forms , however , do not exist ; compare this to the lack of third-person dual forms in the old germanic languages likewise , akkadian had a dual number , though its use was confined to standard phrases like '' two hands '' , '' two eyes '' , and '' two arms '' the dual in hebrew has also atrophied , generally being used for only time , number , and natural pairs ( like body parts ) even in its biblical hebrew khoekhoegowab and other khoe languages mark dual number in their person-gender-number enclitics , though the neuter gender does not have a dual form austronesian languages , particularly polynesian languages such as hawaiian , niuean and tongan , possess a dual number for pronouns but not for nouns , as nouns are generally marked for plural syntactically and not morphologically in biblical , mishnaic , and medieval hebrew , like arabic and other semitic languages , all nouns can have singular , plural or dual forms , and there is still a debate whether there are vestiges of dual verbal forms and pronouns adjectives , verbs , and pronouns have only singular and plural , with the plural forms of these being used with dual nouns languages with dual number

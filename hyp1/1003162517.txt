in 1905 , american psychologist , edward thorndike proposed a ‘ law of effect ’ , which formed the basis of operant conditioning thorndike ’ s ‘ law of effect ’ contained the core elements of what would become known as operant conditioning about fifty years after thorndike ’ s first described the principles of operant conditioning and the law of effect , b skinner theorized that if a behavior is followed by a reward , that behavior is more likely to be repeated , but added that if it is followed by some sort of punishment , it is less likely to be repeated an operant conditioning chamber permits experimenters to study behavior conditioning ( training ) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions ( like pressing a lever ) in response to specific stimuli , such as a light or sound signal for instance , to test how operant conditioning works for certain invertebrates , such as fruit flies , psychologists use a device known as a '' heat box '' essentially this takes up the same form as the skinner box , but the box is composed of two sides : one side that can undergo temperature change and the other that does not modern operant conditioning chambers typically have multiple operanda , such as several response levers , two or more feeders , and a variety of devices capable of generating different stimuli including lights , sounds , music , figures , and drawings skinner ’ s theory of operant conditioning played a key role in helping psychologists to understand how behavior is learned gamification , the technique of using game design elements in non-game contexts , has also been described as using operant conditioning and other behaviorist techniques to encourage desired user behaviors

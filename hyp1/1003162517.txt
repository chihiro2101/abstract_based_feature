in 1905 , american psychologist , edward thorndike proposed a ‘ law of effect ’ , which formed the basis of operant conditioning learning happened when actions led to an effect and that this effect influenced whether the behavior would be repeated thorndike ’ s ‘ law of effect ’ contained the core elements of what would become known as operant conditioning about fifty years after thorndike ’ s first described the principles of operant conditioning and the law of effect , b an operant conditioning chamber permits experimenters to study behavior conditioning ( training ) by teaching a subject animal to perform certain actions ( like pressing a lever ) in response to specific stimuli , such as a light or sound signal for instance , to test how operant conditioning works for certain invertebrates , such as fruit flies , psychologists use a device known as a '' heat box '' the structure forming the shell of a chamber is a box large enough to easily accommodate the animal being used as a subject the other minimal requirement of a conditioning chamber is that it has a means of delivering a primary reinforcer ( a reward , such as food , etc operant conditioning chambers have become common in a variety of research disciplines especially in animal learning skinner ’ s theory of operant conditioning played a key role in helping psychologists to understand how behavior is learned

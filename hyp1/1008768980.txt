since bajor had formally aligned itself with the cardassians some time before , it was considered an internal matter between the cardassian union and a member/subject planet this caused some resentment towards the federation by the bajoran people , especially when the federation was initially invited to administer deep space nine in 2369 , the cardassian civilian authorities ordered the military to withdraw from bajor , after which the bajoran provisional government invited the united federation of planets to set up base on the former cardassian mining station of terok nor , renaming it deep space nine , and requesting membership into the federation star trek : deep space nine in 2369 , when commander ( later captain ) benjamin sisko was assigned command of ds9 , one of his instructions was to prepare bajor for full membership into the federation ( pilot episode : '' emissary '' ) sisko , acting as emissary of the prophets , warned that if bajor were to join the federation at that time , it would mean the destruction of that world at the start of the dominion war , bajor officially declared their neutrality ( '' call to arms '' ) , although many bajorans joined starfleet and , as well , a new resistance to the occupation of deep space nine is formed like many aliens on star trek , the bajorans are human-like in appearance , but have a distinctive symmetrical facial feature : a series of horizontal ridges on the bridge of the nose between the eyes bajoran women gestate for five months , as opposed to the nine months of human women , due to high vascularization between the fetus and the mother as a result , any attempt to remove the fetus prematurely , especially during the later stages of pregnancy , would cause massive blood loss to the mother and severe distress to the baby bajorans typically consider it an honor when they are addressed correctly by offworlders bajorans ' spiritual lives center around the orbs—alien objects believed to have been sent by the prophets ( the gods ) —each of which has a unique ability such as the orb of time , which allows those viewing it to revisit past events nine orbs have been discovered over the centuries ( plus the orb of the emissary , during the final season episode '' shadows and symbols '' ) ;

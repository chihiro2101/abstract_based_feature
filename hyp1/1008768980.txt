in 2318 the cardassian union , which had been taken over by a military dictatorship , invaded bajor , occupying it for fifty years , during which time they forced many bajorans into slave labor , using them in their various mining operations this forced many bajorans to flee and live in refugee camps away from cardassian domination , while other bajorans became involved in the resistance movement , organising terrorism attacks against cardassian targets the federation could not intervene in the situation , due to prime directive considerations ; since bajor had formally aligned itself with the cardassians some time before , it was considered an internal matter between the cardassian union and a member/subject planet this caused some resentment towards the federation by the bajoran people , especially when the federation was initially invited to administer deep space nine in 2369 , the cardassian civilian authorities ordered the military to withdraw from bajor , after which the bajoran provisional government invited the united federation of planets to set up base on the former cardassian mining station of terok nor , renaming it deep space nine , and requesting membership into the federation in 2369 , when commander ( later captain ) benjamin sisko was assigned command of ds9 , one of his instructions was to prepare bajor for full membership into the federation ( pilot episode : '' emissary '' ) sisko , acting as emissary of the prophets , warned that if bajor were to join the federation at that time , it would mean the destruction of that world like many aliens on star trek , the bajorans are human-like in appearance , but have a distinctive symmetrical facial feature : a series of horizontal ridges on the bridge of the nose between the eyes bajorans ' spiritual lives center around the orbs—alien objects believed to have been sent by the prophets ( the gods ) —each of which has a unique ability such as the orb of time , which allows those viewing it to revisit past events nine orbs have been discovered over the centuries ( plus the orb of the emissary , during the final season episode '' shadows and symbols '' ) ; eight were seized by the cardassians during the occupation bajorans wear large , chained earrings and ear cuffs called d'ja pagh on their right ears , as symbols of their religious faith when akorem laan encountered major kira he recognized from the style of her earring that she is a member of the artisan d'jarra , even though she was a member of the military , and she explained that the different styles of earring no longer signified anything jumja sticks are large , dark red , roughly diamond-shaped popsicle-like sweet confectionery treats , though , some other races , like romulans have commented that they can be a little too sweet a day on bajor lasts 26 hours , and deep space nine also follows a 26-hour day other inhabited planets in the bajoran star system include andros ( bajor viii ) , a class k planet ( similar to mars ) and the fifth moon of bajor , jeraddo the prophets , or '' the wormhole aliens '' ( as they are referred to by most non-bajorans ) exist within the wormhole connecting the alpha and gamma quadrants , the alpha quadrant end being located within the bajoran solar system this wormhole is referred to as the celestial temple by the bajoran people the prophets experience time differently , with their first ( known ) encounter with corporeal beings ( benjamin sisko ) resulting in a long and confusing conversation as to how linear time works bajoran spiritual leaders such as kais and vedeks can feel the pagh of another by pinching the lobe of one 's ear , though many find this scrutiny to be slightly unsettling religious practices are unclear after kai opaka departed in 2369 , the election of a new kai from the members of the vedek assembly led to the election of kai winn , who remained kai until her demise in 2375 the central figure in the bajoran faith is known as '' the emissary '' , a being believed to be sent by the prophets to aid bajor for example , even the politically ambitious kai winn sought religious guidance from the emissary , and akorem laan was able to single-handedly reinstate the observance of the obsolete d'jarra caste system in 2372 when he briefly claimed the title of emissary pagh wraiths ( also spelled pah wraiths , bajoran for soul wraiths ) are the enemies of the bajoran prophets bajoran religious texts state that the pagh-wraiths once resided in the celestial temple ( the bajoran wormhole ) alongside the prophets and , like them , are similar non-corporeal beings according to ancient bajoran texts , the pagh wraiths were '' false prophets '' the bajoran militia was the military arm of the bajoran provisional government , originally made up of many former resistance fighters from the occupation of bajor when starfleet forces initially arrived at deep space nine , the kai was a woman named opaka sulan she was then consumed and killed by the pagh wraiths , leaving the post of kai again vacant at the end of the deep space nine television series in the non-canon mmorpg star trek online , set thirty years after the events of deep space nine , it is implied that kira nerys eventually became kai

according to the fictional storyline of the star trek universe , the bajorans are an ancient species who developed advanced technology before the human evolution star trek : the next generation they eventually developed space-faring ships , which took them as far away as the planet of cardassia star trek : deep space nine in 2318 the cardassian union , which had been taken over by a military dictatorship , invaded bajor , occupying it for fifty years , during which time they forced many bajorans into slave labor , using them in their various mining operations this forced many bajorans to flee and live in refugee camps away from cardassian domination , while other bajorans became involved in the resistance movement , organising terrorism attacks against cardassian targets this caused some resentment towards the federation by the bajoran people , especially when the federation was initially invited to administer deep space nine in 2369 , the cardassian civilian authorities ordered the military to withdraw from bajor , after which the bajoran provisional government invited the united federation of planets to set up base on the former cardassian mining station of terok nor , renaming it deep space nine , and requesting membership into the federation star trek : deep space nine in 2369 , when commander ( later captain ) benjamin sisko was assigned command of ds9 , one of his instructions was to prepare bajor for full membership into the federation ( pilot episode : '' emissary '' ) at the start of the dominion war , bajor officially declared their neutrality ( '' call to arms '' ) , although many bajorans joined starfleet and , as well , a new resistance to the occupation of deep space nine is formed like many aliens on star trek , the bajorans are human-like in appearance , but have a distinctive symmetrical facial feature : a series of horizontal ridges on the bridge of the nose between the eyes nine orbs have been discovered over the centuries ( plus the orb of the emissary , during the final season episode '' shadows and symbols '' ) ; eight were seized by the cardassians during the occupation the bajoran people were originally divided into castes , called d'jarras , that dictated a person 's place in bajoran society ; members of a lower-ranking d'jarra were expected to defer to those of a higher caste when the former bajoran spiritual leader , akorem laan , attempted to reintroduce the caste system , it was rejected because it would have made bajor ineligible for federation membership ( caste-based discrimination is forbidden under federation law ) bajorans wear large , chained earrings and ear cuffs called d'ja pagh on their right ears , as symbols of their religious faith jumja sticks are large , dark red , roughly diamond-shaped popsicle-like sweet confectionery treats , though , some other races , like romulans have commented that they can be a little too sweet ( '' past tense ( part 1 ) season 3 , episode 11 ) bajor , the seventh planet in the system , orbits the star bajor-b'hava'el in the bajoran sector other inhabited planets in the bajoran star system include andros ( bajor viii ) , a class k planet ( similar to mars ) and the fifth moon of bajor , jeraddo the bajoran religion , also called the way of the prophets , is a major unifying force on the planet the prophets experience time differently , with their first ( known ) encounter with corporeal beings ( benjamin sisko ) resulting in a long and confusing conversation as to how linear time works one 's pagh can also be stolen by the pagh wraiths , members of the race of '' wormhole aliens '' who have been expelled from the wormhole for being evil there are some orthodox groups within the religion who take a rather dim view of science ( more specifically a scientific interpretation of the wormhole ) and the beliefs of other species , but this is a small minority , with relatively little support among the people in the next generation episode '' the next phase '' , ro laren mentions that some traditional bajoran funeral rites can go on for over three hours when the cardassian empire occupied bajor , the d'jara system was abandoned so all bajoran citizens could become soldiers and fight in the resistance whereas the prophets are analogous to angels or even gods , the pagh wraiths are analogous to demons despite this , the cult of the pagh wraiths became more popular on bajor as an alternative religion to that of the prophets , after many bajorans felt the prophets had abandoned them due to the closure of the wormhole it was said in the star trek : deep space nine episode '' rapture '' that if bajor joins the united federation of planets , most of the bajoran militia would be absorbed into starfleet in the deep space nine premiere episode '' emissary '' , captain jean luc picard informs benjamin sisko that one of his tasks as commander of ds9 is to develop a continuing evaluation of bajor for potential membership in the united federation of planets also , the bajoran government ( here named the third republic of bajor ) begins selecting a councillor to represent bajor on the federation council

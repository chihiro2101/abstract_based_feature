brushed dc motors rotate continuously when dc voltage is applied to their terminals stepper motors effectively have multiple '' toothed '' electromagnets arranged as a stator around a central rotor , a gear-shaped piece of iron to make the motor shaft turn , first , one electromagnet is given power , which magnetically attracts the gear 's teeth this means that when the next electromagnet is turned on and the first is turned off , the gear rotates slightly to align with the next one each of those rotations is called a '' step '' , with an integer number of steps making a full rotation the circular arrangement of electromagnets is divided into groups , each group called a phase , and there is an equal number of electromagnets per group the number of groups is chosen by the designer of the stepper motor for example , if the stepper motor has two groups identified as a or b , and ten electromagnets in total , then the grouping pattern would be ababababab because of this , stepper motors with more phases typically have more wires ( or leads ) to control the motor this detent has a predictable spring rate and specified torque limit ; slippage occurs if the limit is exceeded thumb a unipolar stepper motor has one winding with center tap per phase each section of windings is switched on for each direction of magnetic field often , these two phase commons are internally joined , so the motor has only five leads one way to distinguish the center tap ( common wire ) from a coil-end wire is by measuring the resistance because windings are better utilized , they are more powerful than a unipolar motor of the same weight a unipolar motor has twice the amount of wire in the same space , but only half used at any point in time , hence is 50 % efficient ( or approximately 70 % of the torque output available ) an 8-lead stepper is like a unipolar stepper , but the leads are not joined to common internally to the motor multi-phase stepper motors with many phases tend to have much lower levels of vibration to overcome the inductance and switch the windings quickly , one must increase the drive voltage an additional limitation , often comparable to the effects of inductance , is the back-emf of the motor l/r driver circuits are also referred to as voltage source drives because a constant positive or negative voltage is applied to each winding to set the step positions however , it is winding current , not voltage that applies torque to the stepper motor shaft the inductance l determines the maximum rate of change of the current in the winding according to the formula for an inductor di/dt v/l on each winding , a '' supply '' voltage is applied to the winding as a square wave voltage ; example 8 khz 0 % results in full v/r current in one direction it also allows the controller to output predetermined current levels rather than fixed thumb a stepper motor is a polyphase ac synchronous motor ( see theory below ) , and it is ideally driven by sinusoidal current a full-step waveform is a gross approximation of a sinusoid , and is the reason why the motor exhibits so much vibration wave drive ( one phase on ) it has the same number of steps as the full-step drive , but the motor will have significantly less torque than rated so there will be 25×4 100 steps per full rotation and each step will be 360/100 3.6 degrees this is the usual method for full-step driving the motor two phases are always on so the motor will provide its maximum rated torque the motor also has less torque ( approx 70 % ) at the full-step position ( where only a single phase is on ) so there will be 25×8 200 steps per full rotation and each step will be 360/200 1.8° a step motor can be viewed as a synchronous ac motor with the number of poles ( on both rotor and stator ) increased , taking care that they have no common denominator this measurement is taken across a wide range of speeds and the results are used to generate the stepper motor 's dynamic performance curve more on what is an ip65 step motor : the us national electrical manufacturers association ( nema ) standardises various aspects of stepper motors ; stepper motors : the stepper motor is an electromagnetic device that converts digital pulses into mechanical shaft rotation stepper motor animation controlling a stepper motor without microcontroller zaber microstepping tutorial

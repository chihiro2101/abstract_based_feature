brushed dc motors rotate continuously when dc voltage is applied to their terminals the stepper motor is known for its property of converting a train of input pulses ( typically square waves ) into a precisely defined increment in the shaft ’ s rotational position to make the motor shaft turn , first , one electromagnet is given power , which magnetically attracts the gear 's teeth this means that when the next electromagnet is turned on and the first is turned off , the gear rotates slightly to align with the next one each of those rotations is called a '' step '' , with an integer number of steps making a full rotation in that way , the motor can be turned by a precise angle the circular arrangement of electromagnets is divided into groups , each group called a phase , and there is an equal number of electromagnets per group for example , if the stepper motor has two groups identified as a or b , and ten electromagnets in total , then the grouping pattern would be ababababab because of this , stepper motors with more phases typically have more wires ( or leads ) to control the motor this detent has a predictable spring rate and specified torque limit ; slippage occurs if the limit is exceeded there are two basic winding arrangements for the electromagnetic coils in a two phase stepper motor : bipolar and unipolar thumb a unipolar stepper motor has one winding with center tap per phase since in this arrangement a magnetic pole can be reversed without switching the direction of current , the commutation circuit can be made very simple ( e.g often , these two phase commons are internally joined , so the motor has only five leads for the experimenter , the windings can be identified by touching the terminal wires together in pm motors one way to distinguish the center tap ( common wire ) from a coil-end wire is by measuring the resistance whenever a higher than normal resistance is felt , it indicates that the circuit to the particular winding is closed and that the phase is working bipolar motors have a single winding per phase a typical driving pattern for a two coil bipolar stepper motor would be : a+ b+ a− b− static friction effects using an h-bridge have been observed with certain drive topologies a unipolar motor has twice the amount of wire in the same space , but only half used at any point in time , hence is 50 % efficient ( or approximately 70 % of the torque output available ) though a bipolar stepper motor is more complicated to drive , the abundance of driver chips means this is much less difficult to achieve an 8-lead stepper is like a unipolar stepper , but the leads are not joined to common internally to the motor this requires higher current but can perform better as the winding inductance is reduced bipolar with a single winding per phase this method will run the motor on only half the available windings , which will reduce the available low speed torque but require less current multi-phase stepper motors with many phases tend to have much lower levels of vibration stepper motor performance is strongly dependent on the driver circuit to overcome the inductance and switch the windings quickly , one must increase the drive voltage an additional limitation , often comparable to the effects of inductance , is the back-emf of the motor as the motor 's rotor turns , a sinusoidal voltage is generated proportional to the speed ( step rate ) l/r driver circuits are also referred to as voltage source drives because a constant positive or negative voltage is applied to each winding to set the step positions however , it is winding current , not voltage that applies torque to the stepper motor shaft the inductance l determines the maximum rate of change of the current in the winding according to the formula for an inductor di/dt v/l the resulting current for a voltage pulse is a quickly increasing current as a function of inductance thus when controlled by a constant voltage drive , the maximum speed of a stepper motor is limited by its inductance since at some speed , the voltage u will be changing faster than the current i can keep up with an l/r drive it is possible to control a low voltage resistive motor with a higher voltage drive simply by adding an external resistor in series with each winding wave drive and single phase full step are both one and the same , with same number of steps but difference in torque ; stepper motors : the stepper motor is an electromagnetic device that converts digital pulses into mechanical shaft rotation stepper motor animation controlling a stepper motor without microcontroller zaber microstepping tutorial

brushed dc motors rotate continuously when dc voltage is applied to their terminals the stepper motor is known for its property of converting a train of input pulses ( typically square waves ) into a precisely defined increment in the shaft ’ s rotational position stepper motors effectively have multiple '' toothed '' electromagnets arranged as a stator around a central rotor , a gear-shaped piece of iron to make the motor shaft turn , first , one electromagnet is given power , which magnetically attracts the gear 's teeth the circular arrangement of electromagnets is divided into groups , each group called a phase , and there is an equal number of electromagnets per group the number of groups is chosen by the designer of the stepper motor for example , if the stepper motor has two groups identified as a or b , and ten electromagnets in total , then the grouping pattern would be ababababab because of this , stepper motors with more phases typically have more wires ( or leads ) to control the motor if current is removed a lesser detent still remains , therefore holding shaft position against spring or other torque influences whereas hybrid synchronous are a combination of the permanent magnet and variable reluctance types , to maximize power in a small size vr motors do not have power off detents there are two basic winding arrangements for the electromagnetic coils in a two phase stepper motor : bipolar and unipolar thumb a unipolar stepper motor has one winding with center tap per phase one way to distinguish the center tap ( common wire ) from a coil-end wire is by measuring the resistance bipolar motors have a single winding per phase a typical driving pattern for a two coil bipolar stepper motor would be : a+ b+ a− b− static friction effects using an h-bridge have been observed with certain drive topologies though a bipolar stepper motor is more complicated to drive , the abundance of driver chips means this is much less difficult to achieve this gives higher inductance but lower current per winding this requires higher current but can perform better as the winding inductance is reduced bipolar with a single winding per phase while they are more expensive , they do have a higher power density and with the appropriate drive electronics are often better suited to the application this leads further to the necessity of limiting the current that these high voltages may otherwise induce as the motor 's rotor turns , a sinusoidal voltage is generated proportional to the speed ( step rate ) this ac voltage is subtracted from the voltage waveform available to induce a change in the current l/r driver circuits are also referred to as voltage source drives because a constant positive or negative voltage is applied to each winding to set the step positions the inductance l determines the maximum rate of change of the current in the winding according to the formula for an inductor di/dt v/l the resulting current for a voltage pulse is a quickly increasing current as a function of inductance in simple terms the rate of change of current is l / r ( e.g to obtain high torque at high speeds requires a large drive voltage with a low resistance and low inductance with an l/r drive it is possible to control a low voltage resistive motor with a higher voltage drive simply by adding an external resistor in series with each winding it is therefore considered a low performing option , albeit simple and cheap modern voltage-mode drivers overcome some of these limitations by approximating a sinusoidal voltage waveform to the motor phases chopper drive circuits are most often used with two-winding bipolar motors , the two windings being driven independently to provide a specific motor torque cw or ccw two phases are always on so the motor will provide its maximum rated torque so there will be 25×8 200 steps per full rotation and each step will be 360/200 1.8° this is the measure of the torque produced by a stepper motor when it is operated without an acceleration state an unloaded or under loaded motor may , and often will , stall if the vibration experienced is enough to cause loss of synchronisation advantages of step motors are low cost , high reliability , high torque at low speeds and a simple , rugged construction that operates in almost any environment stepper motor animation controlling a stepper motor without microcontroller zaber microstepping tutorial

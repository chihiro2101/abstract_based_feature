brushed dc motors rotate continuously when dc voltage is applied to their terminals the stepper motor is known for its property of converting a train of input pulses ( typically square waves ) into a precisely defined increment in the shaft ’ s rotational position to make the motor shaft turn , first , one electromagnet is given power , which magnetically attracts the gear 's teeth each of those rotations is called a '' step '' , with an integer number of steps making a full rotation the circular arrangement of electromagnets is divided into groups , each group called a phase , and there is an equal number of electromagnets per group the number of groups is chosen by the designer of the stepper motor because of this , stepper motors with more phases typically have more wires ( or leads ) to control the motor pulses move the rotor in discrete steps , cw or ccw there are two basic winding arrangements for the electromagnetic coils in a two phase stepper motor : bipolar and unipolar thumb a unipolar stepper motor has one winding with center tap per phase each section of windings is switched on for each direction of magnetic field typically , given a phase , the center tap of each winding is made common : giving three leads per phase and six leads for a typical two phase motor often , these two phase commons are internally joined , so the motor has only five leads resistance between common wire and coil-end wire is always half of the resistance between coil-end wires a quick way to determine if the stepper motor is working is to short circuit every two pairs and try turning the shaft a typical driving pattern for a two coil bipolar stepper motor would be : a+ b+ a− b− with an h bridge ) , then remove current from coil a ; then drive coil b with negative current ( again flipping polarity same as coil a ) ; the cycle is complete and begins anew because windings are better utilized , they are more powerful than a unipolar motor of the same weight a unipolar motor has twice the amount of wire in the same space , but only half used at any point in time , hence is 50 % efficient ( or approximately 70 % of the torque output available ) though a bipolar stepper motor is more complicated to drive , the abundance of driver chips means this is much less difficult to achieve higher-phase count stepper motors multi-phase stepper motors with many phases tend to have much lower levels of vibration while they are more expensive , they do have a higher power density and with the appropriate drive electronics are often better suited to the application stepper motor performance is strongly dependent on the driver circuit to overcome the inductance and switch the windings quickly , one must increase the drive voltage an additional limitation , often comparable to the effects of inductance , is the back-emf of the motor however , it is winding current , not voltage that applies torque to the stepper motor shaft the current i in each winding is related to the applied voltage v by the winding inductance l and the winding resistance r thus when controlled by a constant voltage drive , the maximum speed of a stepper motor is limited by its inductance since at some speed , the voltage u will be changing faster than the current i can keep up chopper drive circuits are referred to as controlled current drives because they generate a controlled current in each winding rather than applying a constant voltage chopper drive circuits are most often used with two-winding bipolar motors , the two windings being driven independently to provide a specific motor torque cw or ccw 100 % results in full current in the opposite direction this requires additional electronics to sense winding currents , and control the switching , but it allows stepper motors to be driven with higher torque at higher speeds than l/r drives thumb a stepper motor is a polyphase ac synchronous motor ( see theory below ) , and it is ideally driven by sinusoidal current a step motor can be viewed as a synchronous ac motor with the number of poles ( on both rotor and stator ) increased , taking care that they have no common denominator at low speeds the stepper motor can synchronize itself with an applied step frequency , and this pull-in torque must overcome friction and inertia the resultant current promotes damping , so the drive circuit characteristics are important more on what is an ip65 step motor : the us national electrical manufacturers association ( nema ) standardises various aspects of stepper motors not all drivers are suitable to run all motors , so when designing a motion control system the driver selection process is critical stepper motor animation controlling a stepper motor without microcontroller zaber microstepping tutorial

brushed dc motors rotate continuously when dc voltage is applied to their terminals the stepper motor is known for its property of converting a train of input pulses ( typically square waves ) into a precisely defined increment in the shaft ’ s rotational position stepper motors effectively have multiple '' toothed '' electromagnets arranged as a stator around a central rotor , a gear-shaped piece of iron to make the motor shaft turn , first , one electromagnet is given power , which magnetically attracts the gear 's teeth the circular arrangement of electromagnets is divided into groups , each group called a phase , and there is an equal number of electromagnets per group for example , if the stepper motor has two groups identified as a or b , and ten electromagnets in total , then the grouping pattern would be ababababab because of this , stepper motors with more phases typically have more wires ( or leads ) to control the motor stepping can then be resumed while reliably being synchronized with control electronics whereas hybrid synchronous are a combination of the permanent magnet and variable reluctance types , to maximize power in a small size there are two basic winding arrangements for the electromagnetic coils in a two phase stepper motor : bipolar and unipolar thumb a unipolar stepper motor has one winding with center tap per phase typically , given a phase , the center tap of each winding is made common : giving three leads per phase and six leads for a typical two phase motor for the experimenter , the windings can be identified by touching the terminal wires together in pm motors a quick way to determine if the stepper motor is working is to short circuit every two pairs and try turning the shaft whenever a higher than normal resistance is felt , it indicates that the circuit to the particular winding is closed and that the phase is working a typical driving pattern for a two coil bipolar stepper motor would be : a+ b+ a− b− because windings are better utilized , they are more powerful than a unipolar motor of the same weight this requires higher current but can perform better as the winding inductance is reduced this method will run the motor on only half the available windings , which will reduce the available low speed torque but require less current multi-phase stepper motors with many phases tend to have much lower levels of vibration torque curve may be extended to greater speeds if the stator poles can be reversed more quickly , the limiting factor being a combination of the winding inductance an additional limitation , often comparable to the effects of inductance , is the back-emf of the motor however , it is winding current , not voltage that applies torque to the stepper motor shaft the resulting current for a voltage pulse is a quickly increasing current as a function of inductance thus when controlled by a constant voltage drive , the maximum speed of a stepper motor is limited by its inductance since at some speed , the voltage u will be changing faster than the current i can keep up a 10 & nbsp ; mh inductance with 2 ohms resistance will take 5 & nbsp ; ms to reach approx 2/3 of maximum torque or around 24 & nbsp ; ms to reach 99 % of max torque ) with an l/r drive it is possible to control a low voltage resistive motor with a higher voltage drive simply by adding an external resistor in series with each winding modern voltage-mode drivers overcome some of these limitations by approximating a sinusoidal voltage waveform to the motor phases chopper drive circuits are referred to as controlled current drives because they generate a controlled current in each winding rather than applying a constant voltage chopper drive circuits are most often used with two-winding bipolar motors , the two windings being driven independently to provide a specific motor torque cw or ccw this current level is monitored by the controller by measuring the voltage across a small sense resistor in series with the winding a full-step waveform is a gross approximation of a sinusoid , and is the reason why the motor exhibits so much vibration it has the same number of steps as the full-step drive , but the motor will have significantly less torque than rated so there will be 25×4 100 steps per full rotation and each step will be 360/100 3.6 degrees the motor also has less torque ( approx 70 % ) at the full-step position ( where only a single phase is on ) this is the measure of the torque produced by a stepper motor when it is operated without an acceleration state the stepper motor pull-out torque is measured by accelerating the motor to the desired speed and then increasing the torque loading until the motor stalls or misses steps stepper motors ' nameplates typically give only the winding current and occasionally the voltage and winding resistance ;

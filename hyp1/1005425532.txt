brushed dc motors rotate continuously when dc voltage is applied to their terminals the stepper motor is known for its property of converting a train of input pulses ( typically square waves ) into a precisely defined increment in the shaft â€™ s rotational position stepper motors effectively have multiple '' toothed '' electromagnets arranged as a stator around a central rotor , a gear-shaped piece of iron to make the motor shaft turn , first , one electromagnet is given power , which magnetically attracts the gear 's teeth this means that when the next electromagnet is turned on and the first is turned off , the gear rotates slightly to align with the next one each of those rotations is called a '' step '' , with an integer number of steps making a full rotation in that way , the motor can be turned by a precise angle the circular arrangement of electromagnets is divided into groups , each group called a phase , and there is an equal number of electromagnets per group the number of groups is chosen by the designer of the stepper motor for example , if the stepper motor has two groups identified as a or b , and ten electromagnets in total , then the grouping pattern would be ababababab because of this , stepper motors with more phases typically have more wires ( or leads ) to control the motor if current is removed a lesser detent still remains , therefore holding shaft position against spring or other torque influences thumb a unipolar stepper motor has one winding with center tap per phase for the experimenter , the windings can be identified by touching the terminal wires together in pm motors if the terminals of a coil are connected , the shaft becomes harder to turn resistance between common wire and coil-end wire is always half of the resistance between coil-end wires this is because there is twice the length of coil between the ends and only half from center ( common wire ) to the end a quick way to determine if the stepper motor is working is to short circuit every two pairs and try turning the shaft see '' friction and the dead zone '' by douglas w jones dithering the stepper signal at a higher frequency than the motor can respond to will reduce this '' static friction '' effect a unipolar motor has twice the amount of wire in the same space , but only half used at any point in time , hence is 50 % efficient ( or approximately 70 % of the torque output available ) though a bipolar stepper motor is more complicated to drive , the abundance of driver chips means this is much less difficult to achieve this kind of motor can be wired in several configurations : unipolar bipolar with parallel windings this requires higher current but can perform better as the winding inductance is reduced multi-phase stepper motors with many phases tend to have much lower levels of vibration torque curve may be extended to greater speeds if the stator poles can be reversed more quickly , the limiting factor being a combination of the winding inductance an additional limitation , often comparable to the effects of inductance , is the back-emf of the motor l/r driver circuits are also referred to as voltage source drives because a constant positive or negative voltage is applied to each winding to set the step positions however , it is winding current , not voltage that applies torque to the stepper motor shaft the resistance r determines the maximum current according to ohm 's law i v/r the resulting current for a voltage pulse is a quickly increasing current as a function of inductance with an l/r drive it is possible to control a low voltage resistive motor with a higher voltage drive simply by adding an external resistor in series with each winding it is therefore considered a low performing option , albeit simple and cheap modern voltage-mode drivers overcome some of these limitations by approximating a sinusoidal voltage waveform to the motor phases thumb a stepper motor is a polyphase ac synchronous motor ( see theory below ) , and it is ideally driven by sinusoidal current in animated figure shown above , if we change it to half-stepping , then it will take 8 steps to rotate by 1 teeth position this undesirable ringing is experienced as motor rotor vibration and is more pronounced in unloaded motors the main disadvantages in using a stepper motor is the resonance effect often exhibited at low speeds and decreasing torque with increasing speed the motors response to digital input pulses provides open-loop control , making the motor simpler and less costly to control stepper motor animation controlling a stepper motor without microcontroller zaber microstepping tutorial

the lineage of homotherium is estimated ( based on mitochondrial dna sequences ) to have diverged from that of smilodon about 18 million years ago homotherium probably derived from machairodus and appeared for the first time at the mioceneâ€“pliocene border , about 4 to 5 million years ago alan turner : '' the evolution of the guild of larger terrestrial carnivores during the plio-pleistocene in africa '' during the pleistocene it occurred in vast parts of eurasia , north america and until the middle pleistocene ( about 1.5 million years ago ) even in africa crenatidens was inadvertently dredged from the bed of the north sea , which was a flat , low-lying extent of marshy tundra laced with rivers during the last glacial period new saber-toothed cat records ( felidae : machairodontinae ) for the pleistocene of venezuela , and the great american biotic interchange journal of vertebrate paleontology , 31 ( 2 ) , 468-478 doi : 10.1080/02724634.2011.550366 how long they lasted in south america is not yet evident homotherium survived in eurasia until about 28,000 years ago several eurasian species have been recognized based mainly on differences in the size and shape of the upper canines and body size : h however , given the range of sizes found in extant large cats , it is likely that they represent a single species , homotherium latidens in north america a very similar species , h the american homotherium was originally described by the name dinobastis despite homotheriums vast range and the large quantity of fossil remains from eurasia , africa and north america , complete skeletons of this cat are relatively rare homotherium had unusual limb proportions , with longer , more robust forelimbs that gave it a hyena-like appearance in north america fossil remains of homotherium are less abundant than those of its contemporary smilodon

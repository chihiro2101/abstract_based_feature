left the name homotherium ( greek : , 'same ' ) and , 'beast ' ) ) was proposed by emilio fabrini ( 1890 ) , without further explanation , for a new subgenus of machairodus , whose main distinguishing feature was the presence of a large diastema between the two inferior premolars the lineage of homotherium is estimated ( based on mitochondrial dna sequences ) to have diverged from that of smilodon about 18 million years ago homotherium probably derived from machairodus and appeared for the first time at the mioceneâ€“pliocene border , about 4 to 5 million years ago during the pleistocene it occurred in vast parts of eurasia , north america and until the middle pleistocene ( about 1.5 million years ago ) even in africa ( bbc news ) paul rincon , '' big cat fossil found in north sea '' , 18 november 2008 accessed 18 november 2008 there has also been a discovery of 1.8-million-year-old fossils in venezuela , indicating that scimitar-toothed cats were able to invade south america along with smilodon during the great american interchange new saber-toothed cat records ( felidae : machairodontinae ) for the pleistocene of venezuela , and the great american biotic interchange journal of vertebrate paleontology , 31 ( 2 ) , 468-478 doi : 10.1080/02724634.2011.550366 how long they lasted in south america is not yet evident several eurasian species have been recognized based mainly on differences in the size and shape of the upper canines and body size : h two species described from early pleistocene africa , h in the southern parts of its range the american homotherium co-existed with smilodon ; in the northern parts it was the only species of saber-toothed cat despite homotheriums vast range and the large quantity of fossil remains from eurasia , africa and north america , complete skeletons of this cat are relatively rare compared to more familiar machairodonts , like smilodon or megantereon , homotherium had comparatively shorter upper canines , but these flat , serrated teeth were still longer than those of any living cat left the decline of homotherium could be a result of the disappearance of large herbivorous mammals like mammoths in america at the end of the pleistocene in north america fossil remains of homotherium are less abundant than those of its contemporary smilodon at the well known friesenhahn cave site in texas , the remains of almost 400 juvenile mammoths were discovered along with numerous homotherium skeletons of all ages , from elderly specimens to cubs

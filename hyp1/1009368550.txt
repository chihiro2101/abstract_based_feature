left the name homotherium ( greek : , 'same ' ) and , 'beast ' ) ) was proposed by emilio fabrini ( 1890 ) , without further explanation , for a new subgenus of machairodus , whose main distinguishing feature was the presence of a large diastema between the two inferior premolars the lineage of homotherium is estimated ( based on mitochondrial dna sequences ) to have diverged from that of smilodon about 18 million years ago homotherium probably derived from machairodus and appeared for the first time at the mioceneâ€“pliocene border , about 4 to 5 million years ago during the pleistocene it occurred in vast parts of eurasia , north america and until the middle pleistocene ( about 1.5 million years ago ) even in africa ( bbc news ) paul rincon , '' big cat fossil found in north sea '' , 18 november 2008 accessed 18 november 2008 there has also been a discovery of 1.8-million-year-old fossils in venezuela , indicating that scimitar-toothed cats were able to invade south america along with smilodon during the great american interchange new saber-toothed cat records ( felidae : machairodontinae ) for the pleistocene of venezuela , and the great american biotic interchange journal of vertebrate paleontology , 31 ( 2 ) , 468-478 doi : 10.1080/02724634.2011.550366 how long they lasted in south america is not yet evident several eurasian species have been recognized based mainly on differences in the size and shape of the upper canines and body size : h however , given the range of sizes found in extant large cats , it is likely that they represent a single species , homotherium latidens in north america a very similar species , h despite homotheriums vast range and the large quantity of fossil remains from eurasia , africa and north america , complete skeletons of this cat are relatively rare one of the most famous sites of homotherium remains is friesenhahn cave in texas , where 30 homotherium skeletons were found , along with hundreds of juvenile mammoths and several dire wolf however , a 2018 study by figueirido and colleagues found that homotherium possessed a bite adapted to clamp and hold while inflicting damage with its canines that was more similar to a lion 's due to the larger amounts of trabecular bone present in the skulls of the genus in north america fossil remains of homotherium are less abundant than those of its contemporary smilodon homotherium also seemed to have retained the excellent nocturnal vision typical of most cats , and hunting at night in the arctic regions where many homotherium have been found would have been a prime hunting method

the lineage of homotherium is estimated ( based on mitochondrial dna sequences ) to have diverged from that of smilodon about 18 million years ago homotherium probably derived from machairodus and appeared for the first time at the mioceneâ€“pliocene border , about 4 to 5 million years ago alan turner : '' the evolution of the guild of larger terrestrial carnivores during the plio-pleistocene in africa '' during the pleistocene it occurred in vast parts of eurasia , north america and until the middle pleistocene ( about 1.5 million years ago ) even in africa new saber-toothed cat records ( felidae : machairodontinae ) for the pleistocene of venezuela , and the great american biotic interchange journal of vertebrate paleontology , 31 ( 2 ) , 468-478 doi : 10.1080/02724634.2011.550366 how long they lasted in south america is not yet evident homotherium survived in eurasia until about 28,000 years ago however , given the range of sizes found in extant large cats , it is likely that they represent a single species , homotherium latidens on the african continent the genus disappeared about 1.5 million years ago in north america a very similar species , h in the southern parts of its range the american homotherium co-existed with smilodon ; in the northern parts it was the only species of saber-toothed cat despite homotheriums vast range and the large quantity of fossil remains from eurasia , africa and north america , complete skeletons of this cat are relatively rare one of the most famous sites of homotherium remains is friesenhahn cave in texas , where 30 homotherium skeletons were found , along with hundreds of juvenile mammoths and several dire wolf homotheirums incisors and lower canines formed a powerful puncturing and gripping device ; among living cats , only the tiger ( panthera tigris ) has such large incisors , which aid in lifting and carrying prey in north america fossil remains of homotherium are less abundant than those of its contemporary smilodon

left the name homotherium ( greek : , 'same ' ) and , 'beast ' ) ) was proposed by emilio fabrini ( 1890 ) , without further explanation , for a new subgenus of machairodus , whose main distinguishing feature was the presence of a large diastema between the two inferior premolars the lineage of homotherium is estimated ( based on mitochondrial dna sequences ) to have diverged from that of smilodon about 18 million years ago homotherium probably derived from machairodus and appeared for the first time at the mioceneâ€“pliocene border , about 4 to 5 million years ago alan turner : '' the evolution of the guild of larger terrestrial carnivores during the plio-pleistocene in africa '' during the pleistocene it occurred in vast parts of eurasia , north america and until the middle pleistocene ( about 1.5 million years ago ) even in africa new saber-toothed cat records ( felidae : machairodontinae ) for the pleistocene of venezuela , and the great american biotic interchange journal of vertebrate paleontology , 31 ( 2 ) , 468-478 doi : 10.1080/02724634.2011.550366 how long they lasted in south america is not yet evident homotherium survived in eurasia until about 28,000 years ago several eurasian species have been recognized based mainly on differences in the size and shape of the upper canines and body size : h however , given the range of sizes found in extant large cats , it is likely that they represent a single species , homotherium latidens on the african continent the genus disappeared about 1.5 million years ago in the southern parts of its range the american homotherium co-existed with smilodon ; in the northern parts it was the only species of saber-toothed cat the american homotherium was originally described by the name dinobastis 2008 : a biomechanical constraint on body mass in terrestrial mammalian predators again similarly to the cheetah , the visual cortex in homotheriums brain was large and complex , implying that the scimitar cat relied heavily on vision during the hunt

left the name homotherium ( greek : , 'same ' ) and , 'beast ' ) ) was proposed by emilio fabrini ( 1890 ) , without further explanation , for a new subgenus of machairodus , whose main distinguishing feature was the presence of a large diastema between the two inferior premolars the lineage of homotherium is estimated ( based on mitochondrial dna sequences ) to have diverged from that of smilodon about 18 million years ago homotherium probably derived from machairodus and appeared for the first time at the mioceneâ€“pliocene border , about 4 to 5 million years ago during the pleistocene it occurred in vast parts of eurasia , north america and until the middle pleistocene ( about 1.5 million years ago ) even in africa ( bbc news ) paul rincon , '' big cat fossil found in north sea '' , 18 november 2008 accessed 18 november 2008 there has also been a discovery of 1.8-million-year-old fossils in venezuela , indicating that scimitar-toothed cats were able to invade south america along with smilodon during the great american interchange new saber-toothed cat records ( felidae : machairodontinae ) for the pleistocene of venezuela , and the great american biotic interchange journal of vertebrate paleontology , 31 ( 2 ) , 468-478 doi : 10.1080/02724634.2011.550366 how long they lasted in south america is not yet evident however , given the range of sizes found in extant large cats , it is likely that they represent a single species , homotherium latidens in the southern parts of its range the american homotherium co-existed with smilodon ; in the northern parts it was the only species of saber-toothed cat despite homotheriums vast range and the large quantity of fossil remains from eurasia , africa and north america , complete skeletons of this cat are relatively rare one of the most famous sites of homotherium remains is friesenhahn cave in texas , where 30 homotherium skeletons were found , along with hundreds of juvenile mammoths and several dire wolf homotherium had the general appearance of a cat , but had a number of atypical features for a felid in north america fossil remains of homotherium are less abundant than those of its contemporary smilodon african homotherium species seem to have hunted early pleistocene species of deinotherium , likely preferring to target the more vulnerable adolescents or calves in a herd based on this fossil site , homotherium was likely a social predator that would have been specialized in hunting young mammoths and that subsequently dragged the kills into secluded caves to eat in relative peace

bodyboarding originates from an ancient form of riding waves ( surfing ) on one 's belly alaia boards were generally made from the wood of acacia koa and varied in length and shape tom morey hybridized this form of riding waves on one 's belly on a paipo to his craft of shaping stand-up surfboards three basic forms of riding a bodyboard include prone , dropknee , and stand-up riding prone refers to when one rides the wave on their stomach dropknee is when one places their preferred fin forward on the front of the deck with the opposing knee on the bottom end of the board with their fin dragging in the water dropknee was first pioneered in the late 1970s by hawaii 's jack '' the ripper '' lindholm and sometimes referred to as '' jack stance '' unlike fiberglass stand-up surfboards , the bodyboards dropknee riders use do n't have fins underneath to help maintain a line on the face of a wave or to stop them sliding out so dropknee riders rely on weight transition from rail to rail to hold a line on a wave and turn/snap stand-up consists of standing upright on the board and performing tricks on the face as well as in the air while it is n't quite as popular as the other two forms of riding a bodyboard , three notable figures that popularized it are danny kim , cavin yap , and chris won taloa the bodyboard differs from a surfboard in that it is much shorter ( typically in length ) and made out of different types of foam the modern board consists of a foam 'core ' encapsulated by a plastic bottom , a softer foam top known as the deck , and softer foam sides known as the rails if the wide point of the board is nearer to the nose , the board tends to be best suited to prone riding as the bodyboarder 's weight rests further up on the board most modern boards are equipped with channels that increase surface area in the critical parts of the board which , in turn , allow it to have varying hold and control on the wave however , progressive bodyboarding has rendered use of such skegs obsolete due to the looseness required for maneuverability on a wave the evolution of maneuvers and waves in which it is being done have rendered it one of the most extreme wave riding forms in the world these include aerial 360s , ars ( air roll spin ) , el rollos , inverts ( tweaking the board with the momentum of the wave and then swinging it back ) , backflips , ats ( aéreo thiago schmitd ) and variations/hybrids of these maneuvers are also performed air reverse 720° : originally completed by hawaii 's jeff hubbard mike stewart ( hawaii , usa ) is considered the father of modern bodyboarding , acclaimed as one of the best wave riders of all time , and holds nine world titles ben severson ( hawaii , usa ) is a pioneer of bodyboarding , world champion , and competitive rival of mike stewart for over fifteen years ben player ( australia ) is also considered one of the greatest influences in bodyboarding both australia and the world from 1982–1993 , the winner of the international morey boogie bodyboard pro championships at pipeline , hawaii was considered world champion

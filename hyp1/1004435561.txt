bodyboarding originates from an ancient form of riding waves ( surfing ) on one 's belly indigenous polynesians rode '' alaia '' ( pronounced ah-lie-ah ) boards either on their belly , knees , or feet ( in rare instances ) tom morey hybridized this form of riding waves on one 's belly on a paipo to his craft of shaping stand-up surfboards three basic forms of riding a bodyboard include prone , dropknee , and stand-up riding prone refers to when one rides the wave on their stomach on the other hand , the benefit of not having fins underneath the board is that a rider can spin 360 ( forward and reverse ) stand-up consists of standing upright on the board and performing tricks on the face as well as in the air while it is n't quite as popular as the other two forms of riding a bodyboard , three notable figures that popularized it are danny kim , cavin yap , and chris won taloa the bodyboard differs from a surfboard in that it is much shorter ( typically in length ) and made out of different types of foam the modern board consists of a foam 'core ' encapsulated by a plastic bottom , a softer foam top known as the deck , and softer foam sides known as the rails each type of foam core , deck , or bottom material gives a bodyboard a different amount of flex and control speed from the bottom turn is increased when a bodyboarder bottom turns and the board flexes and recoils , releasing energy dow ( polyethylene ) cores are best suited to cooler waters as they can be too flexible in warm water arcel and polypro ( polypropylene ) cores are best suited for warmer waters due to their increased overall stiffness deck , rails , and bottom are bonded via various hot air lamination techniques to the core if the wide point of the board is nearer to the nose , the board tends to be best suited to prone riding as the bodyboarder 's weight rests further up on the board originally , skegs were installed to decrease slippage on a wave face however , progressive bodyboarding has rendered use of such skegs obsolete due to the looseness required for maneuverability on a wave air hubb ( forward air to el rollo ) : originally completed by kauai 's jeff hubbard jeff hubbard ( hawaii , usa ) is best known for his phenomenal aerial approach to bodyboarding stephanie petterson won the first official world championship of women 's bodyboarding at pipeline in 1990 the world tour is administered by the association of professional bodyboarders world tour , the governing tour determining bodyboarding 's world champion

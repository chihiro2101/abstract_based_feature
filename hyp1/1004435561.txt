bodyboarding originates from an ancient form of riding waves ( surfing ) on one 's belly indigenous polynesians rode '' alaia '' ( pronounced ah-lie-ah ) boards either on their belly , knees , or feet ( in rare instances ) james cook recorded seeing hawaiian villagers riding such boards when he came to hawaii in 1778 alaia boards then evolved into the more modern '' paipo '' ( pronounced pipe-oh ) board tom morey hybridized this form of riding waves on one 's belly on a paipo to his craft of shaping stand-up surfboards three basic forms of riding a bodyboard include prone , dropknee , and stand-up riding prone refers to when one rides the wave on their stomach dropknee was first pioneered in the late 1970s by hawaii 's jack '' the ripper '' lindholm and sometimes referred to as '' jack stance '' on the other hand , the benefit of not having fins underneath the board is that a rider can spin 360 ( forward and reverse ) stand-up consists of standing upright on the board and performing tricks on the face as well as in the air while it is n't quite as popular as the other two forms of riding a bodyboard , three notable figures that popularized it are danny kim , cavin yap , and chris won taloa the bodyboard differs from a surfboard in that it is much shorter ( typically in length ) and made out of different types of foam each type of foam core , deck , or bottom material gives a bodyboard a different amount of flex and control speed from the bottom turn is increased when a bodyboarder bottom turns and the board flexes and recoils , releasing energy if the wide point of the board is nearer to the nose , the board tends to be best suited to prone riding as the bodyboarder 's weight rests further up on the board however , progressive bodyboarding has rendered use of such skegs obsolete due to the looseness required for maneuverability on a wave for such reasons , skegs are rarely used today and , even then , almost exclusively by dropknee or stand-up bodyboarders crescent tails are also preferred by beginners , due to being able to perform well in varying conditions ben player ( australia ) is also considered one of the greatest influences in bodyboarding both australia and the world stephanie petterson won the first official world championship of women 's bodyboarding at pipeline in 1990 from 1982â€“1993 , the winner of the international morey boogie bodyboard pro championships at pipeline , hawaii was considered world champion men 's bodyboarding world tour .

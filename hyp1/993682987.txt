recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post the fundamental results the researchers obtained established computable function as the correct formalization of the informal idea of effective calculation nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis , the church–turing thesis , which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function it seems to me that this importance is largely due to the fact that with this concept one has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute notion to an interesting epistemological notion , i.e the study of which mathematical constructions can be effectively performed is sometimes called recursive mathematics ; the handbook of recursive mathematics ( ershov et al the main form of computability studied in recursion theory was introduced by turing ( 1936 ) a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) the use of turing machines here is not necessary ; there are many other model of computation that have the same computing power as turing machines ; for example the mu-recursive function obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine in contemporary use , the term '' computable function '' has various definitions : according to cutland ( 1980 ) , it is a partial recursive function ( which can be undefined for some inputs ) , while according to soare ( 1987 ) it is a total recursive ( equivalently , general recursive ) function not every set of natural numbers is computable the existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countable set turing machines , and thus only countably many computable sets , but according to the cantor 's theorem , there are uncountable set sets of natural numbers thus the halting problem is an example of a recursively enumerable set , which is a set that can be enumerated by a turing machine ( other terms for recursively enumerable include computably enumerable and semidecidable ) beginning with the theory of recursive sets and functions described above , the field of recursion theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics these are not independent areas of research : each of these areas draws ideas and results from the others , and most recursion theorists are familiar with the majority of them recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) each question will be immediately answered correctly , even if the oracle set is not computable if a set a is turing reducible to a set b and b is turing reducible to a then the sets are said to have the same turing degree ( also called degree of unsolvability ) the turing degree of a set gives a precise measure of how uncomputable the set is the natural examples of sets that are not computable , including many different sets that encode variants of the halting problem , have two properties in common : they are recursively enumerable , and each can be translated into any other via a many-one reduction the index sets given here are even complete for their levels , that is , all the sets in these levels can be many-one reduced to the given index sets this method is primarily used to construct recursively enumerable sets with particular properties besides the lattice of recursively enumerable sets , automorphisms are also studied for the structure of the turing degrees of all sets as well as for the structure of the turing degrees of r.e gödel 's proofs show that the set of logical consequences of an effective first-order theory is a recursively enumerable set , and that if the theory is strong enough this set will be uncomputable recursion theory is also linked to second order arithmetic , a formal theory of natural numbers and sets of natural numbers not every total computable function is provably total in peano arithmetic , however ; an example of such a function is provided by goodstein 's theorem soare , a prominent researcher in the field , has proposed ( soare 1996 ) that the field should be called '' computability theory '' instead some commentators argue that both the names recursion theory and computability theory fail to convey the fact that most of the objects studied in recursion theory are not computable the main professional organization for recursion theory is the association for symbolic logic , which holds several research conferences each year

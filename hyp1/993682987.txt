recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post the fundamental results the researchers obtained established computable function as the correct formalization of the informal idea of effective calculation these results led stephen kleene ( 1952 ) to coin the two names '' church 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:300 ) and '' turing 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:376 ) nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis , the church–turing thesis , which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function although initially skeptical , by 1946 gödel argued in favor of this thesis : : '' tarski has stressed in his lecture ( and i think justly ) the great importance of the concept of general recursiveness ( or turing 's computability ) it seems to me that this importance is largely due to the fact that with this concept one has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute notion to an interesting epistemological notion , i.e both reprintings have the following footnote added to the davis volume by gödel in 1965 : '' to be more precise : a function of integers is computable in any formal system containing arithmetic if and only if it is computable in arithmetic , where a function f is called computable in s if there is in s a computable term representing f ( p the list of undecidable problems gives additional examples of problems with no computable solution the main form of computability studied in recursion theory was introduced by turing ( 1936 ) a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine not every set of natural numbers is computable the recursively enumerable sets , although not decidable in general , have been studied in detail in recursion theory beginning with the theory of recursive sets and functions described above , the field of recursion theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics these are not independent areas of research : each of these areas draws ideas and results from the others , and most recursion theorists are familiar with the majority of them recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) an oracle turing machine is a hypothetical device which , in addition to performing the actions of a regular turing machine , is able to ask questions of an oracle , which is a particular set of natural numbers the oracle machine may only ask questions of the form '' is n in the oracle set ? '' thus an oracle machine with a noncomputable oracle will be able to compute sets that a turing machine without an oracle can not the weakest such axiom studied in reverse mathematics is recursive comprehension , which states that the powerset of the naturals is closed under turing reducibility a friedberg numbering ( named after its discoverer ) is a one-one numbering of all partial-recursive functions ; it is necessarily not an admissible numbering later research dealt also with numberings of other classes like classes of recursively enumerable sets priority arguments have been employed to solve many problems in recursion theory , and have been classified into a hierarchy based on their complexity ( soare 1987 ) recursive sets can be defined in this structure by the basic result that a set is recursive if and only if the set and its complement are both recursively enumerable this branch of recursion theory analyzed the following question : for fixed m and n with 0 & nbsp ; 1 , & nbsp ; x 2 , & nbsp ; gödel 's proofs show that the set of logical consequences of an effective first-order theory is a recursively enumerable set , and that if the theory is strong enough this set will be uncomputable not every total computable function is provably total in peano arithmetic , however ; an example of such a function is provided by goodstein 's theorem some commentators argue that both the names recursion theory and computability theory fail to convey the fact that most of the objects studied in recursion theory are not computable rogers ( 1967 ) has suggested that a key property of recursion theory is that its results and structures should be invariant under computable bijections on the natural numbers ( this suggestion draws on the ideas of the erlangen program in geometry )

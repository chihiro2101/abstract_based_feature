computable and uncomputable sets recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post the fundamental results the researchers obtained established computable function as the correct formalization of the informal idea of effective calculation nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis , the church–turing thesis , which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function although initially skeptical , by 1946 gödel argued in favor of this thesis : : '' tarski has stressed in his lecture ( and i think justly ) the great importance of the concept of general recursiveness ( or turing 's computability ) the main form of computability studied in recursion theory was introduced by turing ( 1936 ) a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set ( also called a decidable , recursive , or turing computable set ) if there is a turing machine that , given a number n , halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) the use of turing machines here is not necessary ; there are many other model of computation that have the same computing power as turing machines ; for example the mu-recursive function obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine the halting problem , which is the set of ( descriptions of ) turing machines that halt on input 0 , is a well-known example of a noncomputable set the existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countable set turing machines , and thus only countably many computable sets , but according to the cantor 's theorem , there are uncountable set sets of natural numbers equivalently , a set is recursively enumerable if and only if it is the range of some computable function the recursively enumerable sets , although not decidable in general , have been studied in detail in recursion theory recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) an oracle turing machine is a hypothetical device which , in addition to performing the actions of a regular turing machine , is able to ask questions of an oracle , which is a particular set of natural numbers informally , a set of natural numbers a is turing reduction to a set b if there is an oracle machine that correctly tells whether numbers are in a when run with b as the oracle set ( in this case , the set a is also said to be ( relatively ) computable from b and recursive in b ) if a set a is turing reducible to a set b and b is turing reducible to a then the sets are said to have the same turing degree ( also called degree of unsolvability ) the natural examples of sets that are not computable , including many different sets that encode variants of the halting problem , have two properties in common : they are recursively enumerable , and each can be translated into any other via a many-one reduction that is , given such sets a and b , there is a total computable function f such that a has the property that either the halting problem or its complement is many-one reducible to e , that is , can be mapped using a many-one reduction to e ( see rice 's theorem for more detail ) : for further explanation , see the section post 's problem and the priority method in the article turing degree it may happen that satisfying one requirement will cause another to become unsatisfied ; the priority order is used to decide what to do in such an event priority arguments have been employed to solve many problems in recursion theory , and have been classified into a hierarchy based on their complexity ( soare 1987 ) recursive sets can be defined in this structure by the basic result that a set is recursive if and only if the set and its complement are both recursively enumerable maximal sets ( as defined in the previous paragraph ) have the property that they can not be automorphic to non-maximal sets , that is , if there is an automorphism of the recursive enumerable sets under the structure just mentioned , then every maximal set is mapped to another maximal set this branch of recursion theory analyzed the following question : for fixed m and n with 0 & nbsp ; 1 , & nbsp ; x 2 , & nbsp ; the first major result in this branch of recursion theory is trakhtenbrot 's result that a set is computable if it is ( m , & nbsp ; n ) -recursive for some m , & nbsp ; n with 2m & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; n soare , a prominent researcher in the field , has proposed ( soare 1996 ) that the field should be called '' computability theory '' instead some commentators argue that both the names recursion theory and computability theory fail to convey the fact that most of the objects studied in recursion theory are not computable

recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post these results led stephen kleene ( 1952 ) to coin the two names '' church 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:300 ) and '' turing 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:376 ) nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis , the church–turing thesis , which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function although initially skeptical , by 1946 gödel argued in favor of this thesis : : '' tarski has stressed in his lecture ( and i think justly ) the great importance of the concept of general recursiveness ( or turing 's computability ) it seems to me that this importance is largely due to the fact that with this concept one has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute notion to an interesting epistemological notion , i.e this result showed that there is no algorithmic procedure that can correctly decide whether arbitrary mathematical propositions are true or false the study of which mathematical constructions can be effectively performed is sometimes called recursive mathematics ; the handbook of recursive mathematics ( ershov et al the main form of computability studied in recursion theory was introduced by turing ( 1936 ) a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set ( also called a decidable , recursive , or turing computable set ) if there is a turing machine that , given a number n , halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) the use of turing machines here is not necessary ; there are many other model of computation that have the same computing power as turing machines ; for example the mu-recursive function obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine not every set of natural numbers is computable the halting problem , which is the set of ( descriptions of ) turing machines that halt on input 0 , is a well-known example of a noncomputable set equivalently , a set is recursively enumerable if and only if it is the range of some computable function the recursively enumerable sets , although not decidable in general , have been studied in detail in recursion theory beginning with the theory of recursive sets and functions described above , the field of recursion theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics these are not independent areas of research : each of these areas draws ideas and results from the others , and most recursion theorists are familiar with the majority of them recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) thus an oracle machine with a noncomputable oracle will be able to compute sets that a turing machine without an oracle can not if a set a is turing reducible to a set b and b is turing reducible to a then the sets are said to have the same turing degree ( also called degree of unsolvability ) these type of sets can be classified using the arithmetical hierarchy the set-existence axioms in question correspond informally to axioms saying that the powerset of the natural numbers is closed under various reducibility notions numberings can be partial-recursive although some of its members are total recursive , that is , computable functions for that reason , a recent research conference in this area was held in january 2007 conference on logic , computability and randomness , january 10–13 , 2007 gödel 's proofs show that the set of logical consequences of an effective first-order theory is a recursively enumerable set , and that if the theory is strong enough this set will be uncomputable the field of mathematical logic dealing with computability and its generalizations has been called '' recursion theory '' since its early days some commentators argue that both the names recursion theory and computability theory fail to convey the fact that most of the objects studied in recursion theory are not computable according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers

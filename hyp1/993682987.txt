computable and uncomputable sets recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post nowadays these are often considered as a single hypothesis , the church–turing thesis , which states that any function that is computable by an algorithm is a computable function although initially skeptical , by 1946 gödel argued in favor of this thesis : : '' tarski has stressed in his lecture ( and i think justly ) the great importance of the concept of general recursiveness ( or turing 's computability ) it seems to me that this importance is largely due to the fact that with this concept one has for the first time succeeded in giving an absolute notion to an interesting epistemological notion , i.e both reprintings have the following footnote added to the davis volume by gödel in 1965 : '' to be more precise : a function of integers is computable in any formal system containing arithmetic if and only if it is computable in arithmetic , where a function f is called computable in s if there is in s a computable term representing f ( p church ( 1936a , 1936b ) and turing ( 1936 ) , inspired by techniques used by gödel ( 1931 ) to prove his incompleteness theorems , independently demonstrated that the entscheidungsproblem is not effectively decidable the study of which mathematical constructions can be effectively performed is sometimes called recursive mathematics ; the handbook of recursive mathematics ( ershov et al the main form of computability studied in recursion theory was introduced by turing ( 1936 ) a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set ( also called a decidable , recursive , or turing computable set ) if there is a turing machine that , given a number n , halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) the use of turing machines here is not necessary ; there are many other model of computation that have the same computing power as turing machines ; for example the mu-recursive function obtained from primitive recursion and the μ operator the definition in terms of μ-recursive functions as well as a different definition of rekursiv functions by gödel led to the traditional name recursive for sets and functions computable by a turing machine in contemporary use , the term '' computable function '' has various definitions : according to cutland ( 1980 ) , it is a partial recursive function ( which can be undefined for some inputs ) , while according to soare ( 1987 ) it is a total recursive ( equivalently , general recursive ) function not every set of natural numbers is computable thus the halting problem is an example of a recursively enumerable set , which is a set that can be enumerated by a turing machine ( other terms for recursively enumerable include computably enumerable and semidecidable ) the recursively enumerable sets , although not decidable in general , have been studied in detail in recursion theory beginning with the theory of recursive sets and functions described above , the field of recursion theory has grown to include the study of many closely related topics recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) the oracle machine may only ask questions of the form '' is n in the oracle set ? '' if a set a is turing reducible to a set b and b is turing reducible to a then the sets are said to have the same turing degree ( also called degree of unsolvability ) the turing degree of a set gives a precise measure of how uncomputable the set is the natural examples of sets that are not computable , including many different sets that encode variants of the halting problem , have two properties in common : they are recursively enumerable , and each can be translated into any other via a many-one reduction post ( 1944 ) introduced already hypersimple and hyperhypersimple sets ; later maximal sets were constructed which are r.e the first major result in this branch of recursion theory is trakhtenbrot 's result that a set is computable if it is ( m , & nbsp ; n ) -recursive for some m , & nbsp ; n with 2m & nbsp ; > & nbsp ; n computability theory for digital computation is well developed gödel 's proofs show that the set of logical consequences of an effective first-order theory is a recursively enumerable set , and that if the theory is strong enough this set will be uncomputable some commentators argue that both the names recursion theory and computability theory fail to convey the fact that most of the objects studied in recursion theory are not computable according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers

computable and uncomputable sets recursion theory originated in the 1930s , with work of kurt gödel , alonzo church , rózsa péter , alan turing , stephen kleene , and emil post many of these foundational papers are collected in the undecidable ( 1965 ) edited by martin davis these results led stephen kleene ( 1952 ) to coin the two names '' church 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:300 ) and '' turing 's thesis '' ( kleene 1952:376 ) although initially skeptical , by 1946 gödel argued in favor of this thesis : : '' tarski has stressed in his lecture ( and i think justly ) the great importance of the concept of general recursiveness ( or turing 's computability ) both reprintings have the following footnote added to the davis volume by gödel in 1965 : '' to be more precise : a function of integers is computable in any formal system containing arithmetic if and only if it is computable in arithmetic , where a function f is called computable in s if there is in s a computable term representing f ( p church ( 1936a , 1936b ) and turing ( 1936 ) , inspired by techniques used by gödel ( 1931 ) to prove his incompleteness theorems , independently demonstrated that the entscheidungsproblem is not effectively decidable this result showed that there is no algorithmic procedure that can correctly decide whether arbitrary mathematical propositions are true or false the study of which mathematical constructions can be effectively performed is sometimes called recursive mathematics ; the handbook of recursive mathematics ( ershov et al a set of natural numbers is said to be a computable set ( also called a decidable , recursive , or turing computable set ) if there is a turing machine that , given a number n , halts with output 1 if n is in the set and halts with output 0 if n is not in the set a function f from the natural numbers to themselves is a recursive or ( turing ) computable function if there is a turing machine that , on input n , halts and returns output f ( n ) not every set of natural numbers is computable the existence of many noncomputable sets follows from the facts that there are only countable set turing machines , and thus only countably many computable sets , but according to the cantor 's theorem , there are uncountable set sets of natural numbers although the halting problem is not computable , it is possible to simulate program execution and produce an infinite list of the programs that do halt thus the halting problem is an example of a recursively enumerable set , which is a set that can be enumerated by a turing machine ( other terms for recursively enumerable include computably enumerable and semidecidable ) recursion theory in mathematical logic has traditionally focused on relative computability , a generalization of turing computability defined using oracle turing machines , introduced by turing & nbsp ; ( 1939 ) each question will be immediately answered correctly , even if the oracle set is not computable if a set a is turing reducible to a set b and b is turing reducible to a then the sets are said to have the same turing degree ( also called degree of unsolvability ) the natural examples of sets that are not computable , including many different sets that encode variants of the halting problem , have two properties in common : they are recursively enumerable , and each can be translated into any other via a many-one reduction that is , given such sets a and b , there is a total computable function f such that a has the property that either the halting problem or its complement is many-one reducible to e , that is , can be mapped using a many-one reduction to e ( see rice 's theorem for more detail ) but , many of these index sets are even more complicated than the halting problem these hierarchy levels are defined inductively , σ n+1 contains just all sets which are recursively enumerable relative to σ n ; σ 1 contains the recursively enumerable sets later research dealt also with numberings of other classes like classes of recursively enumerable sets goncharov discovered for example a class of recursively enumerable sets for which the numberings fall into exactly two classes with respect to recursive isomorphisms : for further explanation , see the section post 's problem and the priority method in the article turing degree harrington gave a further example of an automorphic property : that of the creative sets , the sets which are many-one equivalent to the halting problem besides the lattice of recursively enumerable sets , automorphisms are also studied for the structure of the turing degrees of all sets as well as for the structure of the turing degrees of r.e since any two infinite computable sets are linked by a computable bijection , this proposal identifies all the infinite computable sets ( the finite computable sets are viewed as trivial ) according to rogers , the sets of interest in recursion theory are the noncomputable sets , partitioned into equivalence classes by computable bijections of the natural numbers

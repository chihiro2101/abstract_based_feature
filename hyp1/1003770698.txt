cave bear skeletons were first described in 1774 by johann friedrich esper in his book newly discovered zoolites of unknown four footed animals twenty years later , johann christian rosenmüller , an anatomist at the leipzig university , gave the species its binomial name during world war i , with the scarcity of phosphate dung , earth from the caves where cave bear bones occurred were used as a source of phosphates when the '' dragon caves '' in austria 's styria region were exploited for this purpose , only the skulls and leg bones were kept many caves in central europe have skeletons of cave bears inside , for example the heinrichshöhle in hemer , the dechenhöhle in iserlohn , germany a complete skeleton , five complete skulls , and 18 & nbsp ; other bones were found inside jaskinia niedźwiedzia ( bear cave ) in 1966 in poland with summary in romania , in a cave called bears ' cave , 140 & nbsp ; cave bear skeletons were discovered in 1983 both the cave bear and the brown bear are thought to be descended from the plio-pleistocene etruscan bear ( ursus etruscus ) that lived about 5.3 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago the last common ancestor of cave bears and brown bears lived between 1.2 & ndash ; 1.4 & nbsp ; mya the immediate precursor of the cave bear was probably ursus deningeri ( deninger 's bear ) , a species restricted to pleistocene europe about 1.8 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago ursus spelaeus deningeroides , while other authorities consider both taxa to be chronological variants of the same species this allowed the cave bear to gain more energy for hibernation , while eating less than its ancestors in 2005 , scientists recovered and sequenced the nuclear dna of a cave bear that lived between 42,000 and 44,000 years ago this study confirmed and built on results from a previous study using mitochondrial dna extracted from cave bear remains ranging from 20,000 to 130,000 years old standing close to 3.5 meters ( 11.50 ft ) tall while rearing up , the cave bear had a very broad , domed skull with a steep forehead cave bears grew larger during glaciations and smaller during interglacials , probably to adjust heat loss rate cave bear teeth were very large and show greater wear than most modern bear species , suggesting a diet of tough materials the presence of fully articulated adult cave lion skeletons , deep in cave bear dens , indicates the lions may have occasionally entered dens to prey on hibernating cave bears , with some dying in the attempt compared with other megafaunal species that also became extinct during the last glacial maximum , the cave bear was believed to have had a more specialized diet of high-quality plants and a relatively restricted geographical range some evidence indicates that the cave bear used only caves for hibernation and was not inclined to use other locations , such as thickets , for this purpose , in contrast to the more versatile brown bear this specialized hibernation behavior would have caused a high winter mortality rate for cave bears that failed to find available caves show caves of romania cave bear fossils

cave bear skeletons were first described in 1774 by johann friedrich esper in his book newly discovered zoolites of unknown four footed animals during world war i , with the scarcity of phosphate dung , earth from the caves where cave bear bones occurred were used as a source of phosphates many caves in central europe have skeletons of cave bears inside , for example the heinrichshöhle in hemer , the dechenhöhle in iserlohn , germany a complete skeleton , five complete skulls , and 18 & nbsp ; other bones were found inside jaskinia niedźwiedzia ( bear cave ) in 1966 in poland with summary in romania , in a cave called bears ' cave , 140 & nbsp ; cave bear skeletons were discovered in 1983 psu.edu in august of 2020 a 'completely preserved ' ice age cave bear carcass was found by reindeer herders in russia in a separate discovery , a well preserved cave bear cub was also found both the cave bear and the brown bear are thought to be descended from the plio-pleistocene etruscan bear ( ursus etruscus ) that lived about 5.3 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago the immediate precursor of the cave bear was probably ursus deningeri ( deninger 's bear ) , a species restricted to pleistocene europe about 1.8 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago the transition between deninger 's bear and the cave bear is given as the last interglacial , although the boundary between these forms is arbitrary , and intermediate or transitional taxa have been proposed , e.g in 2005 , scientists recovered and sequenced the nuclear dna of a cave bear that lived between 42,000 and 44,000 years ago sequencing the dna directly ( rather than first replicating it with the polymerase chain reaction ) , the scientists recovered 21 cave bear genes from remains that did not yield significant amounts of dna with traditional techniques this study confirmed and built on results from a previous study using mitochondrial dna extracted from cave bear remains ranging from 20,000 to 130,000 years old the divergence date estimate of cave bears and brown bears is about 1.2–1.4 & nbsp ; mya its stout body had long thighs , massive shins and in-turning feet , making it similar in skeletal structure to the brown bear the humerus of the cave bear was similar in size to that of the polar bear , as were the femora of females the femora of male cave bears , however , bore more similarities in size to those of kodiak bears cave bear teeth were very large and show greater wear than most modern bear species , suggesting a diet of tough materials cave hyenas are thought to be responsible for the disarticulation and destruction of some cave bear skeletons recent reassessment of fossils indicate that the cave bear probably died out 24,000 years ago azykh cave bear cave darband cave dechen cave peștera cu oase divje babe flute show caves of romania cave bear fossils

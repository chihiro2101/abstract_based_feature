cave bear skeletons were first described in 1774 by johann friedrich esper in his book newly discovered zoolites of unknown four footed animals during world war i , with the scarcity of phosphate dung , earth from the caves where cave bear bones occurred were used as a source of phosphates when the '' dragon caves '' in austria 's styria region were exploited for this purpose , only the skulls and leg bones were kept many caves in central europe have skeletons of cave bears inside , for example the heinrichshöhle in hemer , the dechenhöhle in iserlohn , germany a complete skeleton , five complete skulls , and 18 & nbsp ; other bones were found inside jaskinia niedźwiedzia ( bear cave ) in 1966 in poland with summary in romania , in a cave called bears ' cave , 140 & nbsp ; cave bear skeletons were discovered in 1983 psu.edu in august of 2020 a 'completely preserved ' ice age cave bear carcass was found by reindeer herders in russia both the cave bear and the brown bear are thought to be descended from the plio-pleistocene etruscan bear ( ursus etruscus ) that lived about 5.3 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago the last common ancestor of cave bears and brown bears lived between 1.2 & ndash ; 1.4 & nbsp ; mya the immediate precursor of the cave bear was probably ursus deningeri ( deninger 's bear ) , a species restricted to pleistocene europe about 1.8 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago in 2005 , scientists recovered and sequenced the nuclear dna of a cave bear that lived between 42,000 and 44,000 years ago standing close to 3.5 meters ( 11.50 ft ) tall while rearing up , the cave bear had a very broad , domed skull with a steep forehead cave bears were comparable in size to the largest modern-day bears the humerus of the cave bear was similar in size to that of the polar bear , as were the femora of females the femora of male cave bears , however , bore more similarities in size to those of kodiak bears cave bear teeth were very large and show greater wear than most modern bear species , suggesting a diet of tough materials the presence of fully articulated adult cave lion skeletons , deep in cave bear dens , indicates the lions may have occasionally entered dens to prey on hibernating cave bears , with some dying in the attempt also , a cave bear skull was found with a femur bone from another bear stuck inside it recent reassessment of fossils indicate that the cave bear probably died out 24,000 years ago some evidence indicates that the cave bear used only caves for hibernation and was not inclined to use other locations , such as thickets , for this purpose , in contrast to the more versatile brown bear in a study of spanish cave bear mtdna , each cave used by cave bears was found to contain almost exclusively a unique lineage of closely related haplotypes , indicating a homing behaviour for birthing and hibernation show caves of romania cave bear fossils

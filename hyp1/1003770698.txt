cave bear skeletons were first described in 1774 by johann friedrich esper in his book newly discovered zoolites of unknown four footed animals during world war i , with the scarcity of phosphate dung , earth from the caves where cave bear bones occurred were used as a source of phosphates many caves in central europe have skeletons of cave bears inside , for example the heinrichshöhle in hemer , the dechenhöhle in iserlohn , germany a complete skeleton , five complete skulls , and 18 & nbsp ; other bones were found inside jaskinia niedźwiedzia ( bear cave ) in 1966 in poland with summary in romania , in a cave called bears ' cave , 140 & nbsp ; cave bear skeletons were discovered in 1983 psu.edu in august of 2020 a 'completely preserved ' ice age cave bear carcass was found by reindeer herders in russia in a separate discovery , a well preserved cave bear cub was also found both the cave bear and the brown bear are thought to be descended from the plio-pleistocene etruscan bear ( ursus etruscus ) that lived about 5.3 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago the last common ancestor of cave bears and brown bears lived between 1.2 & ndash ; 1.4 & nbsp ; mya the immediate precursor of the cave bear was probably ursus deningeri ( deninger 's bear ) , a species restricted to pleistocene europe about 1.8 & nbsp ; mya to 100,000 & nbsp ; years ago the transition between deninger 's bear and the cave bear is given as the last interglacial , although the boundary between these forms is arbitrary , and intermediate or transitional taxa have been proposed , e.g in 2005 , scientists recovered and sequenced the nuclear dna of a cave bear that lived between 42,000 and 44,000 years ago this study confirmed and built on results from a previous study using mitochondrial dna extracted from cave bear remains ranging from 20,000 to 130,000 years old both show that the cave bear was more closely related to the brown bear and polar bear than it was to the american black bear , but had split from the brown bear lineage before the distinct eastern and western brown bear lineages diversified and before the split of brown bears and polar bears the divergence date estimate of cave bears and brown bears is about 1.2–1.4 & nbsp ; mya standing close to 3.5 meters ( 11.50 ft ) tall while rearing up , the cave bear had a very broad , domed skull with a steep forehead cave bears of the last ice age lacked the usual two or three premolars present in other bears ; to compensate , the last molar is very elongated , with supplementary cusps the humerus of the cave bear was similar in size to that of the polar bear , as were the femora of females the morphological features of the cave bear chewing apparatus , including loss of premolars , have long been suggested to indicate their diets displayed a higher degree of herbivory than the eurasian brown bear also , a cave bear skull was found with a femur bone from another bear stuck inside it in a study of spanish cave bear mtdna , each cave used by cave bears was found to contain almost exclusively a unique lineage of closely related haplotypes , indicating a homing behaviour for birthing and hibernation azykh cave bear cave darband cave dechen cave peștera cu oase divje babe flute

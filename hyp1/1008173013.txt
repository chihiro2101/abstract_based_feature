the established neuroscientific consensus is that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind , such as learning , memory , and consciousness , are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws since the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brain 's neural network , are poorly understood issues , mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulator rather than having to understand the high-level psychological processes and large-scale structures of the brain , and model them using classical artificial intelligence methods and cognitive psychology models , the low-level structure of the underlying neural network is captured , mapped and emulated with a computer system in computer science terminology , rather than analyzing and reverse engineering the behavior of the algorithms and data structures that resides in the brain , a blueprint of its source code is translated to another programming language the human mind and the personal identity then , theoretically , is generated by the emulated neural network in an identical fashion to it being generated by the biological neural network on the other hand , a molecule-scale simulation of the brain is not expected to be required , provided that the functioning of the neurons is not affected by quantum mechanical processes the neural network emulation approach only requires that the functioning and interaction of neurons and synapses are understood a traditional artificial neural network model , for example multi-layer perceptron network model , is not considered as sufficient since learning and long-term memory are believed to result from strengthening or weakening the synapses via a mechanism known as synaptic plasticity or synaptic adaptation , the model should include this mechanism it is considered unlikely that the simulation model has to include protein interaction , which would make it computationally complex when modelling and simulating the brain of a specific individual , a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain for whole brain simulation , this network map should show the connectivity of the whole nervous system , including the spinal cord , sensory receptors , and muscle cells however , if short-term memory and working memory include prolonged or repeated firing of neurons , as well as intra-neural dynamic processes , the electrical and chemical signal state of the synapses and neurons may be hard to extract the uploaded mind may then perceive a memory loss of the events and mental processes immediately before the time of brain scanning a full brain map has been estimated to occupy less than 2 x 10 16 bytes ( 20,000 tb ) and would store the addresses of the connected neurons , the synapse type and the synapse '' weight '' for each of the brains ' 10 15 synapses ) may preclude an accurate prediction of the volume of binary data required to faithfully represent a functioning human mind , 1989 , large scale analysis of neural structures , csl-89-10 november 1989 , p89-00173 the exposed surface of frozen nerve tissue would be scanned and recorded , and then the surface layer of tissue removed atlum project the scans would then be analyzed , and a model of the neural net recreated in the system that the mind was being uploaded into if it is possible to replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone , then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique however , as the physiological genesis of 'mind ' is not currently known , this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity the blue brain project by the brain and mind institute of the école polytechnique fédérale de lausanne , switzerland is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry underlying the concept of '' mind uploading '' ( more accurately '' mind transferring '' ) is the broad philosophy that consciousness lies within the brain 's information processing and is in essence an emergent feature that arises from large neural network high-level patterns of organization , and that the same patterns of organization can be realized in other processing devices mind uploading also relies on the idea that the human mind ( the '' self '' and the long-term memory ) , just like non-human minds , is represented by the current neural network paths and the weights of the brain synapses rather than by a dualistic and mystic soul and spirit data specifying the information state of the neural network can be captured and copied as a '' computer file '' from the brain and re-implemented into a different physical form sometimes the animals would just need to be euthanized in order to extract , slice , and scan their brains , but sometimes behavioral and in vivo measures would be required , which might cause pain to living animals limited computing power would mean the first emulations would run slower and so would be easier to adapt to , and there would be more time for the technology to transition through society waiting might give society more time to think about the consequences of brain emulation and develop institutions to improve cooperation also , emulations may be bulkier and require more hardware than ai , which would also slow the speed of a transition emulations running at digital speeds would have less intelligence differential vis-à-vis ai and so might more easily control ai mind uploading has also been advocated by a number of researchers in neuroscience and artificial intelligence , such as the late marvin minsky

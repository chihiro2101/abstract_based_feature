the human brain contains , on average , about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons , each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called axons and dendrites the established neuroscientific consensus is that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind , such as learning , memory , and consciousness , are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws since the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brain 's neural network , are poorly understood issues , mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulator rather than having to understand the high-level psychological processes and large-scale structures of the brain , and model them using classical artificial intelligence methods and cognitive psychology models , the low-level structure of the underlying neural network is captured , mapped and emulated with a computer system the human mind and the personal identity then , theoretically , is generated by the emulated neural network in an identical fashion to it being generated by the biological neural network since learning and long-term memory are believed to result from strengthening or weakening the synapses via a mechanism known as synaptic plasticity or synaptic adaptation , the model should include this mechanism it is considered unlikely that the simulation model has to include protein interaction , which would make it computationally complex a digital computer simulation model of an analog system such as the brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion the errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate , and sufficiently accurate models of non-linearities when modelling and simulating the brain of a specific individual , a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain the uploaded mind may then perceive a memory loss of the events and mental processes immediately before the time of brain scanning a full brain map has been estimated to occupy less than 2 x 10 16 bytes ( 20,000 tb ) and would store the addresses of the connected neurons , the synapse type and the synapse '' weight '' for each of the brains ' 10 15 synapses however , the biological complexities of true brain function ( e.g ) may preclude an accurate prediction of the volume of binary data required to faithfully represent a functioning human mind if it is possible to replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone , then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique however , as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events ( particularly at synapses , but also at other places on the neuron 's cell membrane ) , this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions however , as the physiological genesis of 'mind ' is not currently known , this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity it may be possible to create functional 3d maps of the brain activity , using advanced neuroimaging technology , such as functional mri ( fmri , for mapping change in blood flow ) , magnetoencephalography ( meg , for mapping of electrical currents ) , or combinations of multiple methods , to build a detailed three-dimensional model of the brain using non-invasive and non-destructive methods today , fmri is often combined with meg for creating functional maps of human cortex during more complex cognitive tasks , as the methods complement each other there is ongoing work in the field of brain simulation , including partial and whole simulations of some animals miller , a professor of neuroscience at columbia and a co-director of the center for theoretical neuroscience , raised doubts about the practicality of mind uploading operation of the brain depends on the dynamics of electrical and biochemical signal exchange between neurons ; therefore , capturing them in a single '' frozen '' state may prove insufficient data specifying the information state of the neural network can be captured and copied as a '' computer file '' from the brain and re-implemented into a different physical form an analogy to the idea of mind uploading is to copy the temporary information state ( the variable values ) of a computer program from the computer memory to another computer and continue its execution whether when my brain has lost its original structure , and when some hundred years after the same materials are fabricated so curiously as to become an intelligent being , whether , i say that being will be me ; or , if , two or three such beings should be formed out of my brain ; whether they will all be me , and consequently one and the same intelligent being however , the philosopher and transhumanist susan schneider claims that at best , uploading would create a copy of the original person 's mind he then concludes : â€œ if , as i argue above , a sufficiently detailed computational simulation of the brain is potentially operationally equivalent to an organic brain , it follows that we must consider extending protections against suffering to simulations this was based on the idea that brain emulation would require understanding some brain components , and it would be easier to tinker with these than to reconstruct the entire brain in its original form mind uploading has also been advocated by a number of researchers in neuroscience and artificial intelligence , such as the late marvin minsky episode four , titled '' how to teleport '' , mentions that mind uploading via techniques such as quantum entanglement and whole brain emulation using an advanced mri machine may enable people to be transported vast distances at near light-speed

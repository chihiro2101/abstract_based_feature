the human brain contains , on average , about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons , each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called axons and dendrites signals at the junctures ( synapses ) of these connections are transmitted by the release and detection of chemicals known as neurotransmitters the established neuroscientific consensus is that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind , such as learning , memory , and consciousness , are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws since the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brain 's neural network , are poorly understood issues , mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulator in computer science terminology , rather than analyzing and reverse engineering the behavior of the algorithms and data structures that resides in the brain , a blueprint of its source code is translated to another programming language the human mind and the personal identity then , theoretically , is generated by the emulated neural network in an identical fashion to it being generated by the biological neural network on the other hand , a molecule-scale simulation of the brain is not expected to be required , provided that the functioning of the neurons is not affected by quantum mechanical processes a dynamic spiking neural network model is required , which reflects that the neuron fires only when a membrane potential reaches a certain level since learning and long-term memory are believed to result from strengthening or weakening the synapses via a mechanism known as synaptic plasticity or synaptic adaptation , the model should include this mechanism a digital computer simulation model of an analog system such as the brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion the computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations , preferably in real time when modelling and simulating the brain of a specific individual , a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain for whole brain simulation , this network map should show the connectivity of the whole nervous system , including the spinal cord , sensory receptors , and muscle cells destructive scanning of a small sample of tissue from a mouse brain including synaptic details is possible as of 2010 the uploaded mind may then perceive a memory loss of the events and mental processes immediately before the time of brain scanning ) may preclude an accurate prediction of the volume of binary data required to faithfully represent a functioning human mind a possible method for mind uploading is serial sectioning , in which the brain tissue and perhaps other parts of the nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer , which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome , thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections while this would be a very slow and labor-intensive process , research is currently underway to automate the collection and microscopy of serial sections if it is possible to replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone , then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique however , as the physiological genesis of 'mind ' is not currently known , this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity the blue brain project by the brain and mind institute of the école polytechnique fédérale de lausanne , switzerland is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry will you ever be able to upload your brain ? , www.nytimes.com the mind or '' soul '' can be defined as the information state of the brain , and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the work-space memory of the computer an analogy to the idea of mind uploading is to copy the temporary information state ( the variable values ) of a computer program from the computer memory to another computer and continue its execution another potential consequence of mind uploading is that the decision to '' upload '' may then create a mindless symbol manipulator instead of a conscious mind ( see philosophical zombie ) the neuroscience required to develop brain emulation would require animal experimentation , first on invertebrates and then on small mammals before moving on to humans brain emulations could be erased by computer viruses or malware , without need to destroy the underlying hardware this was based on the idea that brain emulation would require understanding some brain components , and it would be easier to tinker with these than to reconstruct the entire brain in its original form mind uploading has also been advocated by a number of researchers in neuroscience and artificial intelligence , such as the late marvin minsky these advocates see mind uploading as a medical procedure which could eventually save countless lives

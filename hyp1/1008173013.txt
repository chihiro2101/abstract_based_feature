the human brain contains , on average , about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons , each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called axons and dendrites the established neuroscientific consensus is that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind , such as learning , memory , and consciousness , are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws since the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brain 's neural network , are poorly understood issues , mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulator rather than having to understand the high-level psychological processes and large-scale structures of the brain , and model them using classical artificial intelligence methods and cognitive psychology models , the low-level structure of the underlying neural network is captured , mapped and emulated with a computer system the human mind and the personal identity then , theoretically , is generated by the emulated neural network in an identical fashion to it being generated by the biological neural network on the other hand , a molecule-scale simulation of the brain is not expected to be required , provided that the functioning of the neurons is not affected by quantum mechanical processes the neural network emulation approach only requires that the functioning and interaction of neurons and synapses are understood it is expected that it is sufficient with a black-box signal processing model of how the neurons respond to nerve impulses ( electrical as well as chemical synapse ) it is likely that the model must include delays , non-linear functions and differential equations describing the relation between electrophysical parameters such as electrical currents , voltages , membrane states ( ion channel states ) and neuromodulators it is considered unlikely that the simulation model has to include protein interaction , which would make it computationally complex a digital computer simulation model of an analog system such as the brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion when modelling and simulating the brain of a specific individual , a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain for whole brain simulation , this network map should show the connectivity of the whole nervous system , including the spinal cord , sensory receptors , and muscle cells however , if short-term memory and working memory include prolonged or repeated firing of neurons , as well as intra-neural dynamic processes , the electrical and chemical signal state of the synapses and neurons may be hard to extract however , the biological complexities of true brain function ( e.g atlum project the scans would then be analyzed , and a model of the neural net recreated in the system that the mind was being uploaded into if it is possible to replicate neuron function from its visible structure alone , then the resolution afforded by a scanning electron microscope would suffice for such a technique however , as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events ( particularly at synapses , but also at other places on the neuron 's cell membrane ) , this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions it may be possible to extend the techniques of serial sectioning and to capture the internal molecular makeup of neurons , through the use of sophisticated immunohistochemistry staining methods that could then be read via confocal laser scanning microscopy it may be possible to create functional 3d maps of the brain activity , using advanced neuroimaging technology , such as functional mri ( fmri , for mapping change in blood flow ) , magnetoencephalography ( meg , for mapping of electrical currents ) , or combinations of multiple methods , to build a detailed three-dimensional model of the brain using non-invasive and non-destructive methods the blue brain project by the brain and mind institute of the école polytechnique fédérale de lausanne , switzerland is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry therefore , while not rejecting the idea in principle , miller believes that the complexity of the '' absolute '' duplication of an individual mind is insurmountable for the nearest hundreds of years mind uploading also relies on the idea that the human mind ( the '' self '' and the long-term memory ) , just like non-human minds , is represented by the current neural network paths and the weights of the brain synapses rather than by a dualistic and mystic soul and spirit the mind or '' soul '' can be defined as the information state of the brain , and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the work-space memory of the computer however , the philosopher and transhumanist susan schneider claims that at best , uploading would create a copy of the original person 's mind another potential consequence of mind uploading is that the decision to '' upload '' may then create a mindless symbol manipulator instead of a conscious mind ( see philosophical zombie ) limited computing power would mean the first emulations would run slower and so would be easier to adapt to , and there would be more time for the technology to transition through society also , emulations may be bulkier and require more hardware than ai , which would also slow the speed of a transition because of the postulated difficulties that a whole brain emulation-generated superintelligence would pose for the control problem , computer scientist stuart j episode four , titled '' how to teleport '' , mentions that mind uploading via techniques such as quantum entanglement and whole brain emulation using an advanced mri machine may enable people to be transported vast distances at near light-speed

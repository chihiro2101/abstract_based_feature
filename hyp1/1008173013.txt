the human brain contains , on average , about 86 billion nerve cells called neurons , each individually linked to other neurons by way of connectors called axons and dendrites the established neuroscientific consensus is that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind , such as learning , memory , and consciousness , are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws since the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brain 's neural network , are poorly understood issues , mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulator in computer science terminology , rather than analyzing and reverse engineering the behavior of the algorithms and data structures that resides in the brain , a blueprint of its source code is translated to another programming language the human mind and the personal identity then , theoretically , is generated by the emulated neural network in an identical fashion to it being generated by the biological neural network on the other hand , a molecule-scale simulation of the brain is not expected to be required , provided that the functioning of the neurons is not affected by quantum mechanical processes a traditional artificial neural network model , for example multi-layer perceptron network model , is not considered as sufficient how the neurons are affected by hormones and other chemical substances that may cross the blood–brain barrier it is considered unlikely that the simulation model has to include protein interaction , which would make it computationally complex a digital computer simulation model of an analog system such as the brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion however , the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision , for example due to background noise the errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate , and sufficiently accurate models of non-linearities for whole brain simulation , this network map should show the connectivity of the whole nervous system , including the spinal cord , sensory receptors , and muscle cells destructive scanning of a small sample of tissue from a mouse brain including synaptic details is possible as of 2010 the uploaded mind may then perceive a memory loss of the events and mental processes immediately before the time of brain scanning a full brain map has been estimated to occupy less than 2 x 10 16 bytes ( 20,000 tb ) and would store the addresses of the connected neurons , the synapse type and the synapse '' weight '' for each of the brains ' 10 15 synapses a possible method for mind uploading is serial sectioning , in which the brain tissue and perhaps other parts of the nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer , which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome , thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections however , as the physiological genesis of 'mind ' is not currently known , this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity even though current imaging technology lacks the spatial resolution needed to gather the information needed for such a scan , important recent and future developments are predicted to substantially improve both spatial and temporal resolutions of existing technologies the blue brain project by the brain and mind institute of the école polytechnique fédérale de lausanne , switzerland is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry miller , a professor of neuroscience at columbia and a co-director of the center for theoretical neuroscience , raised doubts about the practicality of mind uploading underlying the concept of '' mind uploading '' ( more accurately '' mind transferring '' ) is the broad philosophy that consciousness lies within the brain 's information processing and is in essence an emergent feature that arises from large neural network high-level patterns of organization , and that the same patterns of organization can be realized in other processing devices the mind or '' soul '' can be defined as the information state of the brain , and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the work-space memory of the computer an analogy to the idea of mind uploading is to copy the temporary information state ( the variable values ) of a computer program from the computer memory to another computer and continue its execution he then concludes : “ if , as i argue above , a sufficiently detailed computational simulation of the brain is potentially operationally equivalent to an organic brain , it follows that we must consider extending protections against suffering to simulations the neuroscience and computer-hardware technologies that may make brain emulation possible are widely desired for other reasons , and logically their development will continue into the future participants at a 2011 ai workshop estimated an 85 % probability that neuromorphic ai would arrive before brain emulation unlike ai , an emulation would n't be able to rapidly expand beyond the size of a human brain mind uploading has also been advocated by a number of researchers in neuroscience and artificial intelligence , such as the late marvin minsky many transhumanists look forward to the development and deployment of mind uploading technology , with transhumanists such as nick bostrom predicting that it will become possible within the 21st century due to technological trends such as moore 's law

the established neuroscientific consensus is that the human mind is largely an emergent property of the information processing of this neural network neuroscientists have stated that important functions performed by the mind , such as learning , memory , and consciousness , are due to purely physical and electrochemical processes in the brain and are governed by applicable laws since the function of the human mind and how it might arise from the working of the brain 's neural network , are poorly understood issues , mind uploading relies on the idea of neural network emulator rather than having to understand the high-level psychological processes and large-scale structures of the brain , and model them using classical artificial intelligence methods and cognitive psychology models , the low-level structure of the underlying neural network is captured , mapped and emulated with a computer system in computer science terminology , rather than analyzing and reverse engineering the behavior of the algorithms and data structures that resides in the brain , a blueprint of its source code is translated to another programming language a traditional artificial neural network model , for example multi-layer perceptron network model , is not considered as sufficient it is considered unlikely that the simulation model has to include protein interaction , which would make it computationally complex a digital computer simulation model of an analog system such as the brain is an approximation that introduces random quantization errors and distortion however , the biological neurons also suffer from randomness and limited precision , for example due to background noise the errors of the discrete model can be made smaller than the randomness of the biological brain by choosing a sufficiently high variable resolution and sample rate , and sufficiently accurate models of non-linearities the computational power and computer memory must however be sufficient to run such large simulations , preferably in real time when modelling and simulating the brain of a specific individual , a brain map or connectivity database showing the connections between the neurons must be extracted from an anatomic model of the brain for whole brain simulation , this network map should show the connectivity of the whole nervous system , including the spinal cord , sensory receptors , and muscle cells a full brain map has been estimated to occupy less than 2 x 10 16 bytes ( 20,000 tb ) and would store the addresses of the connected neurons , the synapse type and the synapse '' weight '' for each of the brains ' 10 15 synapses however , the biological complexities of true brain function ( e.g a possible method for mind uploading is serial sectioning , in which the brain tissue and perhaps other parts of the nervous system are frozen and then scanned and analyzed layer by layer , which for frozen samples at nano-scale requires a cryo-ultramicrotome , thus capturing the structure of the neurons and their interconnections , 1989 , large scale analysis of neural structures , csl-89-10 november 1989 , p89-00173 the exposed surface of frozen nerve tissue would be scanned and recorded , and then the surface layer of tissue removed however , as the function of brain tissue is partially determined by molecular events ( particularly at synapses , but also at other places on the neuron 's cell membrane ) , this may not suffice for capturing and simulating neuron functions however , as the physiological genesis of 'mind ' is not currently known , this method may not be able to access all of the necessary biochemical information to recreate a human brain with sufficient fidelity the blue brain project by the brain and mind institute of the école polytechnique fédérale de lausanne , switzerland is an attempt to create a synthetic brain by reverse-engineering mammalian brain circuitry operation of the brain depends on the dynamics of electrical and biochemical signal exchange between neurons ; therefore , capturing them in a single '' frozen '' state may prove insufficient therefore , while not rejecting the idea in principle , miller believes that the complexity of the '' absolute '' duplication of an individual mind is insurmountable for the nearest hundreds of years will you ever be able to upload your brain ? , www.nytimes.com mind uploading also relies on the idea that the human mind ( the '' self '' and the long-term memory ) , just like non-human minds , is represented by the current neural network paths and the weights of the brain synapses rather than by a dualistic and mystic soul and spirit the mind or '' soul '' can be defined as the information state of the brain , and is immaterial only in the same sense as the information content of a data file or the state of a computer software currently residing in the work-space memory of the computer an analogy to the idea of mind uploading is to copy the temporary information state ( the variable values ) of a computer program from the computer memory to another computer and continue its execution the other computer may perhaps have different hardware architecture but emulates the hardware of the first computer if one ai-development group had a lead in emulation technology , it would have more subjective time to win an arms race to build the first superhuman ai this was based on the idea that brain emulation would require understanding some brain components , and it would be easier to tinker with these than to reconstruct the entire brain in its original form emulations running at digital speeds would have less intelligence differential vis-à-vis ai and so might more easily control ai mind uploading has also been advocated by a number of researchers in neuroscience and artificial intelligence , such as the late marvin minsky

the earliest type of light meters were called extinction meters and contained a numbered or lettered row of neutral density filters of increasing density the photographer would position the meter in front of his subject and note the filter with the greatest density that still allowed incident light to pass through the letter or number corresponding to the filter was used as an index into a chart of appropriate aperture and shutter speed combinations for a given film speed selenium and silicon light meters use sensors that are photovoltaic : they generate a voltage proportional to light exposure selenium sensors generate enough voltage for direct connection to a meter ; they need no battery to operate and this made them very convenient in completely mechanical cameras selenium sensors however can not measure low light accurately ( ordinary lightbulbs can take them close to their limits ) and are altogether unable to measure very low light , such as candlelight , moonlight , starlight etc cds light meters use a photoresistor sensor whose electrical resistance changes proportionately to light exposure many modern consumer still and video cameras include a built-in meter that measures a scene-wide light level and are able to make an approximate measure of appropriate exposure based on that photographers working with controlled lighting and cinematographers use handheld light meters to precisely measure the light falling on various parts of their subjects and use suitable lighting to produce the desired exposure levels reflected-light meters measure the light reflected by the scene to be photographed this pitfall ( but not in the setting-sun case ) is avoided by incident-light meters which measure the amount of light falling on the subject using an integrating sphere ( usually , a translucent hemispherical plastic dome is used to approximate this ) placed on top of the light sensor an experienced photographer can take multiple readings over the shadows , midrange and highlights of the scene to determine optimal exposure , using systems like the zone system many modern cameras include sophisticated multi-segment metering systems that measure the luminance of different parts of the scene to determine the optimal exposure when using a film whose spectral sensitivity is not a good match to that of the light meter , for example orthochromatic black-and-white or infrared film , the meter may require special filters and re-calibration to match the sensitivity of the film what constitutes a “ medium tone ” depends on meter calibration and several other factors , including film processing or digital image conversion for reflected-light meters , camera settings are related to iso speed and subject luminance by the reflected-light exposure equation : \frac where “ effective scene illuminance ” is that measured by a meter with a hemispherical receptor iso 2720:1974 calls for reflected-light calibration to be measured by aiming the receptor at a transilluminated diffuse surface , and for incident-light calibration to be measured by aiming the receptor at a point source in a darkened room for a perfectly diffusing test card and perfectly diffusing flat receptor , the comparison between a reflected-light measurement and an incident-light measurement is valid for any position of the light source calibration of cameras with internal meters is covered by iso 2721:1982 ; nonetheless , many manufacturers specify ( though seldom state ) exposure calibration in terms of k , and many calibration instruments ( e.g light meters or light detectors are also used in lighting exposure metering : relating subject lighting to film exposure ( pdf ) a discussion of meter calibration and its practical effects

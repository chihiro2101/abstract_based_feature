the earliest type of light meters were called extinction meters and contained a numbered or lettered row of neutral density filters of increasing density the photographer would position the meter in front of his subject and note the filter with the greatest density that still allowed incident light to pass through the letter or number corresponding to the filter was used as an index into a chart of appropriate aperture and shutter speed combinations for a given film speed selenium and silicon light meters use sensors that are photovoltaic : they generate a voltage proportional to light exposure selenium sensors however can not measure low light accurately ( ordinary lightbulbs can take them close to their limits ) and are altogether unable to measure very low light , such as candlelight , moonlight , starlight etc cds light meters use a photoresistor sensor whose electrical resistance changes proportionately to light exposure most modern light meters use silicon or cds sensors many modern consumer still and video cameras include a built-in meter that measures a scene-wide light level and are able to make an approximate measure of appropriate exposure based on that photographers working with controlled lighting and cinematographers use handheld light meters to precisely measure the light falling on various parts of their subjects and use suitable lighting to produce the desired exposure levels badly underexposed sunset photos are common exactly because of this effect : the brightness of the setting sun fools the camera 's light meter and , unless the in-camera logic or the photographer take care to compensate , the picture will be grossly underexposed and dull this pitfall ( but not in the setting-sun case ) is avoided by incident-light meters which measure the amount of light falling on the subject using an integrating sphere ( usually , a translucent hemispherical plastic dome is used to approximate this ) placed on top of the light sensor another way to avoid under- or over-exposure for subjects with unusual reflectance is to use a spot meter : a reflected-light meter that measures light in a very tight cone , typically with a one degree circular angle of view when using a film whose spectral sensitivity is not a good match to that of the light meter , for example orthochromatic black-and-white or infrared film , the meter may require special filters and re-calibration to match the sensitivity of the film the calibration of photographic light meters is covered by iso 2720:1974 for reflected-light meters , camera settings are related to iso speed and subject luminance by the reflected-light exposure equation : \frac where “ effective scene illuminance ” is that measured by a meter with a hemispherical receptor however , the response of a hemispherical receptor to an off-axis light source is approximately that of a cardioid rather than a cosine , so the 12 % “ reflectance ” determined for an incident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor is valid only when the light source is on the receptor axis calibration of cameras with internal meters is covered by iso 2721:1982 ; nonetheless , many manufacturers specify ( though seldom state ) exposure calibration in terms of k , and many calibration instruments ( e.g light meters or light detectors are also used in lighting units : for illuminance the units are typically only lux and foot-candles but many light meters can also be used for uv , vis and ir applications so the readout could change to w/cm^2 , candela , watts etc although a light meter can take the form of a very simple handheld tool with one-button operation , there are also many advanced light-measurement systems available for use in numerous different applications exposure metering : relating subject lighting to film exposure ( pdf ) a discussion of meter calibration and its practical effects

the earliest type of light meters were called extinction meters and contained a numbered or lettered row of neutral density filters of increasing density selenium and silicon light meters use sensors that are photovoltaic : they generate a voltage proportional to light exposure selenium sensors however can not measure low light accurately ( ordinary lightbulbs can take them close to their limits ) and are altogether unable to measure very low light , such as candlelight , moonlight , starlight etc cds light meters use a photoresistor sensor whose electrical resistance changes proportionately to light exposure most modern light meters use silicon or cds sensors many modern consumer still and video cameras include a built-in meter that measures a scene-wide light level and are able to make an approximate measure of appropriate exposure based on that photographers working with controlled lighting and cinematographers use handheld light meters to precisely measure the light falling on various parts of their subjects and use suitable lighting to produce the desired exposure levels reflected-light meters measure the light reflected by the scene to be photographed this pitfall ( but not in the setting-sun case ) is avoided by incident-light meters which measure the amount of light falling on the subject using an integrating sphere ( usually , a translucent hemispherical plastic dome is used to approximate this ) placed on top of the light sensor taking an incident-light reading requires placing the meter at the subject 's position and pointing it in the general direction of the camera , something not always achievable in practice , e.g another way to avoid under- or over-exposure for subjects with unusual reflectance is to use a spot meter : a reflected-light meter that measures light in a very tight cone , typically with a one degree circular angle of view an experienced photographer can take multiple readings over the shadows , midrange and highlights of the scene to determine optimal exposure , using systems like the zone system flash meters are used in flash photography to verify correct exposure for reflected-light meters , camera settings are related to iso speed and subject luminance by the reflected-light exposure equation : \frac where “ effective scene illuminance ” is that measured by a meter with a hemispherical receptor for a perfectly diffusing test card and perfectly diffusing flat receptor , the comparison between a reflected-light measurement and an incident-light measurement is valid for any position of the light source calibration of cameras with internal meters is covered by iso 2721:1982 ; nonetheless , many manufacturers specify ( though seldom state ) exposure calibration in terms of k , and many calibration instruments ( e.g light meters or light detectors are also used in lighting the meter/radiometer/photometer portion may have many features including : zero : subtracts ambient/back ground light levels , or stabilize the meter to the working environment hold : freezes the value on the display units : for illuminance the units are typically only lux and foot-candles but many light meters can also be used for uv , vis and ir applications so the readout could change to w/cm^2 , candela , watts etc selenium meter photometer photodetector colorimetry photometry radiometry light value photomultiplier tubes for detecting light at very low levels exposure metering : relating subject lighting to film exposure ( pdf ) a discussion of meter calibration and its practical effects

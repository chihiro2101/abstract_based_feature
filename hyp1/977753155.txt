the earliest type of light meters were called extinction meters and contained a numbered or lettered row of neutral density filters of increasing density the photographer would position the meter in front of his subject and note the filter with the greatest density that still allowed incident light to pass through the letter or number corresponding to the filter was used as an index into a chart of appropriate aperture and shutter speed combinations for a given film speed selenium and silicon light meters use sensors that are photovoltaic : they generate a voltage proportional to light exposure selenium sensors however can not measure low light accurately ( ordinary lightbulbs can take them close to their limits ) and are altogether unable to measure very low light , such as candlelight , moonlight , starlight etc cds light meters use a photoresistor sensor whose electrical resistance changes proportionately to light exposure many modern consumer still and video cameras include a built-in meter that measures a scene-wide light level and are able to make an approximate measure of appropriate exposure based on that photographers working with controlled lighting and cinematographers use handheld light meters to precisely measure the light falling on various parts of their subjects and use suitable lighting to produce the desired exposure levels there are two general types of light meters : reflected-light and incident-light an unusual scene with a preponderance of light colors or specular highlights would have a higher reflectance ; a reflected-light meter taking a reading would incorrectly compensate for the difference in reflectance and lead to underexposure taking an incident-light reading requires placing the meter at the subject 's position and pointing it in the general direction of the camera , something not always achievable in practice , e.g many modern cameras include sophisticated multi-segment metering systems that measure the luminance of different parts of the scene to determine the optimal exposure when using a film whose spectral sensitivity is not a good match to that of the light meter , for example orthochromatic black-and-white or infrared film , the meter may require special filters and re-calibration to match the sensitivity of the film flash meters are used in flash photography to verify correct exposure what constitutes a “ medium tone ” depends on meter calibration and several other factors , including film processing or digital image conversion for reflected-light meters , camera settings are related to iso speed and subject luminance by the reflected-light exposure equation : \frac where “ effective scene illuminance ” is that measured by a meter with a hemispherical receptor for a perfectly diffusing test card and perfectly diffusing flat receptor , the comparison between a reflected-light measurement and an incident-light measurement is valid for any position of the light source the combination of exposure increase and the card orientation gives recommended exposures that are reasonably close to those given by an incident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor when metering with an off-axis light source the sensor will send a signal to the meter that is proportional to the amount of light that reaches the sensor after being collected by the optics and passing through the filter units : for illuminance the units are typically only lux and foot-candles but many light meters can also be used for uv , vis and ir applications so the readout could change to w/cm^2 , candela , watts etc exposure metering : relating subject lighting to film exposure ( pdf ) a discussion of meter calibration and its practical effects

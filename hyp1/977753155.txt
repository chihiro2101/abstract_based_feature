the earliest type of light meters were called extinction meters and contained a numbered or lettered row of neutral density filters of increasing density the photographer would position the meter in front of his subject and note the filter with the greatest density that still allowed incident light to pass through selenium and silicon light meters use sensors that are photovoltaic : they generate a voltage proportional to light exposure selenium sensors however can not measure low light accurately ( ordinary lightbulbs can take them close to their limits ) and are altogether unable to measure very low light , such as candlelight , moonlight , starlight etc cds light meters use a photoresistor sensor whose electrical resistance changes proportionately to light exposure most modern light meters use silicon or cds sensors many modern consumer still and video cameras include a built-in meter that measures a scene-wide light level and are able to make an approximate measure of appropriate exposure based on that photographers working with controlled lighting and cinematographers use handheld light meters to precisely measure the light falling on various parts of their subjects and use suitable lighting to produce the desired exposure levels there are two general types of light meters : reflected-light and incident-light reflected-light meters are calibrated to show the appropriate exposure for “ average ” scenes an unusual scene with a preponderance of light colors or specular highlights would have a higher reflectance ; a reflected-light meter taking a reading would incorrectly compensate for the difference in reflectance and lead to underexposure this pitfall ( but not in the setting-sun case ) is avoided by incident-light meters which measure the amount of light falling on the subject using an integrating sphere ( usually , a translucent hemispherical plastic dome is used to approximate this ) placed on top of the light sensor taking an incident-light reading requires placing the meter at the subject 's position and pointing it in the general direction of the camera , something not always achievable in practice , e.g another way to avoid under- or over-exposure for subjects with unusual reflectance is to use a spot meter : a reflected-light meter that measures light in a very tight cone , typically with a one degree circular angle of view the calibration of photographic light meters is covered by iso 2720:1974 iso 2720:1974 calls for reflected-light calibration to be measured by aiming the receptor at a transilluminated diffuse surface , and for incident-light calibration to be measured by aiming the receptor at a point source in a darkened room for a perfectly diffusing test card and perfectly diffusing flat receptor , the comparison between a reflected-light measurement and an incident-light measurement is valid for any position of the light source calibration of cameras with internal meters is covered by iso 2721:1982 ; nonetheless , many manufacturers specify ( though seldom state ) exposure calibration in terms of k , and many calibration instruments ( e.g the combination of exposure increase and the card orientation gives recommended exposures that are reasonably close to those given by an incident-light meter with a hemispherical receptor when metering with an off-axis light source selenium meter photometer photodetector colorimetry photometry radiometry light value photomultiplier tubes for detecting light at very low levels the problem with lux meters an article suggesting that lux meter may read incorrectly when measuring light not from a tungsten source ( i.e

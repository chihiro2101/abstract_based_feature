the earliest type of light meters were called extinction meters and contained a numbered or lettered row of neutral density filters of increasing density the photographer would position the meter in front of his subject and note the filter with the greatest density that still allowed incident light to pass through the letter or number corresponding to the filter was used as an index into a chart of appropriate aperture and shutter speed combinations for a given film speed selenium and silicon light meters use sensors that are photovoltaic : they generate a voltage proportional to light exposure selenium sensors however can not measure low light accurately ( ordinary lightbulbs can take them close to their limits ) and are altogether unable to measure very low light , such as candlelight , moonlight , starlight etc cds light meters use a photoresistor sensor whose electrical resistance changes proportionately to light exposure most modern light meters use silicon or cds sensors many modern consumer still and video cameras include a built-in meter that measures a scene-wide light level and are able to make an approximate measure of appropriate exposure based on that photographers working with controlled lighting and cinematographers use handheld light meters to precisely measure the light falling on various parts of their subjects and use suitable lighting to produce the desired exposure levels there are two general types of light meters : reflected-light and incident-light reflected-light meters measure the light reflected by the scene to be photographed an unusual scene with a preponderance of light colors or specular highlights would have a higher reflectance ; a reflected-light meter taking a reading would incorrectly compensate for the difference in reflectance and lead to underexposure this pitfall ( but not in the setting-sun case ) is avoided by incident-light meters which measure the amount of light falling on the subject using an integrating sphere ( usually , a translucent hemispherical plastic dome is used to approximate this ) placed on top of the light sensor another way to avoid under- or over-exposure for subjects with unusual reflectance is to use a spot meter : a reflected-light meter that measures light in a very tight cone , typically with a one degree circular angle of view calibration of cameras with internal meters is covered by iso 2721:1982 ; nonetheless , many manufacturers specify ( though seldom state ) exposure calibration in terms of k , and many calibration instruments ( e.g to simulate an average scene , a substitute measurement sometimes is made of a neutral test card , or gray card the instructions for a kodak neutral test card recommend that the indicated exposure be increased by Â½ step for a frontlighted scene in sunlight the instructions also recommend that the test card be held vertically and faced in a direction midway between the sun and the camera ; similar directions are also given in the kodak professional photoguide light meters or light detectors are also used in lighting selenium meter photometer photodetector colorimetry photometry radiometry light value photomultiplier tubes for detecting light at very low levels exposure metering : relating subject lighting to film exposure ( pdf ) a discussion of meter calibration and its practical effects

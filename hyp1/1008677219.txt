intravenous ( iv ) access is used to administer medications and fluid replacement which must be distributed throughout the body , especially when rapid distribution is desired substances that may be infused intravenously include volume expanders , blood-based products , blood substitutes , medications and nutrition fluids may be administered as part of '' volume expansion '' , or fluid replacement , through the intravenous route lactated ringer 's solution used as a fluid expander or base solution to which medications are added also has some buffering effect another solution administered intravenously as a buffering solution is sodium bicarbonate medications may be mixed into the fluids mentioned above , commonly normal saline , or dextrose solutions in atrial fibrillation , iv amiodarone may be administered to attempt to restore normal heart rhythm iv medications can also be used for chronic health conditions such as cancer , for which chemotherapy drugs are commonly administered intravenously in some cases , such as with vancomycin , a loading or bolus dose of medicine is given before beginning a dosing regimen to more quickly increase the concentration of medication in the blood the bioavailability of an iv medication is by definition 100 % , unlike oral administration where medication may not be fully absorbed , or may be metabolized prior to entering the bloodstream in these cases , a medication may be given iv only until the patient can tolerate an oral form of the medication a blood product ( or blood-based product ) is any component of blood which is collected from a donor for use in a blood transfusion blood transfusions can be used in massive blood loss due to trauma , or can be used to replace blood lost during surgery blood transfusions may also be used to treat a severe anaemia or thrombocytopenia caused by a blood disease a person receiving parenteral nutrition will be given an intravenous solution which may contain salts , dextrose , amino acids , lipids and vitamins if a person is only receiving nutrition intravenously , it is called total parenteral nutrition , whereas if a person is only receiving some of their nutrition intravenously it is called partial parenteral nutrition ( or supplemental parenteral nutrition ) the world anti-doping agency prohibits intravenous injection of more than 100ml per 12 hours , except under a medical exemption improperly administered intravenous glucose ( called '' ringer '' ) , such as that which is administered clandestinely in store-front clinics , poses increased risks due to improper technique and oversight a syringe containing the medication is connected to an access port in the primary tubing and the medication is administered through the port in some cases , a bolus of plain iv solution ( i.e without medication added ) is administered immediately after the bolus to further force the medicine into the bloodstream an infusion of medication may be used when it is desirable to have a constant blood concentration of a medication over time , such as with some antibiotics including beta-lactams continuous infusions , where the next infusion is begun immediately following the completion of the prior , may also be used to limit variation in drug concentration in the blood ( i.e they may also be used instead of intermittent bolus injections for the same reason , such as with furosemide when administering a secondary iv medication , the primary bag is held lower than the secondary bag so that the secondary medication can flow into the primary tubing , rather than fluid from the primary bag flowing into the secondary tubing incompatibility of two fluids or medications can arise due to issues of molecular stability , changes in solubility , or degradation of one of the medications a syringe can be connected directly to this needle , which allows for a '' bolus '' dose to be administered alternatively , the needle may be placed and then connected to a length of tubing , allowing for an infusion to be administered a central line versus peripheral line , and in which vein the line is placed ) can be affected by the potential for some medications to cause peripheral vasoconstriction , which limits circulation to peripheral veins this may be placed in the arm , commonly either the wrist or the median cubital vein at the elbow when used , a tourniquet should be removed before injecting medication to prevent extravasation the size of the peripheral vein limits the amount and rate of medication which can be administered safely a peripheral line consists of a short catheter inserted through the skin into a peripheral vein using a tunneled line reduces the risk of infection as compared to other forms of access , as bacteria from the skin surface are not able to travel directly into the vein the incidence of side effects specific to a medication can be affected by the type of access ( peripheral versus central ) , the rate of administration , or the quantity of drug administered it may occur when the vein itself ruptures , when the vein is damaged during insertion of the intravascular access device , or from increased vein porosity there was virtually no recorded success with any attempts at injection therapy until the 1800s , when in 1831 thomas latta studied the use of iv fluid replacements for cholera treatment

intravenous ( iv ) access is used to administer medications and fluid replacement which must be distributed throughout the body , especially when rapid distribution is desired substances that may be infused intravenously include volume expanders , blood-based products , blood substitutes , medications and nutrition fluids may be administered as part of '' volume expansion '' , or fluid replacement , through the intravenous route colloids preserve a high colloid osmotic pressure in the blood , while , on the other hand , this parameter is decreased by crystalloids due to hemodilution buffer solutions which are used to correct acidosis or alkalosis are also administered through intravenous access lactated ringer 's solution used as a fluid expander or base solution to which medications are added also has some buffering effect medications may be mixed into the fluids mentioned above , commonly normal saline , or dextrose solutions compared with other route of administration , such as oral medications , the iv route is the fastest way to deliver fluids and medications throughout the body for this reason , the iv route is commonly preferred in emergency situations or when a fast onset of action is desirable in atrial fibrillation , iv amiodarone may be administered to attempt to restore normal heart rhythm iv medications can also be used for chronic health conditions such as cancer , for which chemotherapy drugs are commonly administered intravenously the bioavailability of an iv medication is by definition 100 % , unlike oral administration where medication may not be fully absorbed , or may be metabolized prior to entering the bloodstream for this reason certain types of medications can only be given intravenously , as there is insufficient uptake by other routes of administration oral medications also may be less desirable if a person is nauseous , vomiting , or has severe diarrhea - as these may prevent the medicine from being fully absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in these cases , a medication may be given iv only until the patient can tolerate an oral form of the medication the switch from iv to oral administration is usually performed as soon as viable , as there is generally cost and time savings over iv administration some medications , such as aprepitant , are chemically modified to be better suited for iv administration , forming a prodrug such as fosaprepitant a blood product ( or blood-based product ) is any component of blood which is collected from a donor for use in a blood transfusion blood transfusions can be used in massive blood loss due to trauma , or can be used to replace blood lost during surgery the exact formulation of a parenteral nutrition used will depend on the specific nutritional needs of the person it is being given to some medications are able to be administered as a bolus dose , which is called an '' iv push '' a syringe containing the medication is connected to an access port in the primary tubing and the medication is administered through the port a bolus may be administered rapidly ( with a fast depression of the syringe plunger ) or may be administered slowly , over the course of a few minutes an infusion of medication may be used when it is desirable to have a constant blood concentration of a medication over time , such as with some antibiotics including beta-lactams intermittent infusion may be used when there are concerns about the stability of medicine in solution for long periods of time ( as is common with continuous infusions ) , or to enable the administration of medicines which would be incompatible if administered at the same time in the same iv line , for example vancomycin any additional medication to be administered intravenously at the same time as an infusion may be connected to the primary tubing ; this is termed a secondary iv , or iv piggyback when administering a secondary iv medication , the primary bag is held lower than the secondary bag so that the secondary medication can flow into the primary tubing , rather than fluid from the primary bag flowing into the secondary tubing the fluid from the primary bag is needed to help flush any remaining medication from the secondary iv from the tubing if a bolus or secondary infusion is intended for administration in the same line as a primary infusion , the molecular compatibility of the solutions must be considered the simplest form of intravenous access is by passing a hollow needle through the skin directly into a vein alternatively , the needle may be placed and then connected to a length of tubing , allowing for an infusion to be administered blood samples may also be drawn from the line directly after the initial iv cannula insertion medication is administered by injecting medication through the skin and the silicone port cover into the reservoir the incidence of side effects specific to a medication can be affected by the type of access ( peripheral versus central ) , the rate of administration , or the quantity of drug administered a central iv line poses a higher risk of sepsis , as it can deliver bacteria directly into the central circulation infiltration occurs when a non-vesicant iv fluid or medication enters the surrounding tissue as opposed to the desired vein furthermore , if a solution which is not isoosmolar is administered , a person 's electrolyte balance may become imbalanced

intravenous ( iv ) access is used to administer medications and fluid replacement which must be distributed throughout the body , especially when rapid distribution is desired another use of iv administration is the avoidance of first-pass metabolism in the liver substances that may be infused intravenously include volume expanders , blood-based products , blood substitutes , medications and nutrition fluids may be administered as part of '' volume expansion '' , or fluid replacement , through the intravenous route volume expansion consists of the administration of fluid-based solutions or suspensions designed to target specific areas of the body which need more water buffer solutions which are used to correct acidosis or alkalosis are also administered through intravenous access lactated ringer 's solution used as a fluid expander or base solution to which medications are added also has some buffering effect medications may be mixed into the fluids mentioned above , commonly normal saline , or dextrose solutions compared with other route of administration , such as oral medications , the iv route is the fastest way to deliver fluids and medications throughout the body for this reason , the iv route is commonly preferred in emergency situations or when a fast onset of action is desirable in atrial fibrillation , iv amiodarone may be administered to attempt to restore normal heart rhythm iv medications can also be used for chronic health conditions such as cancer , for which chemotherapy drugs are commonly administered intravenously the unpredictability of oral bioavailability in different people is also a reason for a medication to be administered iv - as with furosemide oral medications also may be less desirable if a person is nauseous , vomiting , or has severe diarrhea - as these may prevent the medicine from being fully absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract this can be for pharmacokinetic reasons or to delay the effect of the drug until it can be metabolized into the active form parenteral nutrition is the act of providing required nutrients to a person through an intravenous line the exact formulation of a parenteral nutrition used will depend on the specific nutritional needs of the person it is being given to the utility of medical imaging relies on being able to clearly distinguish internal parts of the body from each other - one way this is accomplished is through the administration of a contrast agent into a vein common contrast agents are administered into a peripheral vein from which they are distributed throughout the circulation to the imaging site the world anti-doping agency prohibits intravenous injection of more than 100ml per 12 hours , except under a medical exemption the first '' boutique iv '' clinic , offering similar treatments , opened in tokyo in 2008 intravenous therapy is also used in people with acute ethanol toxicity to correct electrolyte and vitamin deficiencies which arise from alcohol consumption some medications are able to be administered as a bolus dose , which is called an '' iv push '' a bolus may be administered rapidly ( with a fast depression of the syringe plunger ) or may be administered slowly , over the course of a few minutes an infusion of medication may be used when it is desirable to have a constant blood concentration of a medication over time , such as with some antibiotics including beta-lactams they may also be used instead of intermittent bolus injections for the same reason , such as with furosemide any additional medication to be administered intravenously at the same time as an infusion may be connected to the primary tubing ; this is termed a secondary iv , or iv piggyback the fluid from the primary bag is needed to help flush any remaining medication from the secondary iv from the tubing incompatibility of two fluids or medications can arise due to issues of molecular stability , changes in solubility , or degradation of one of the medications the simplest form of intravenous access is by passing a hollow needle through the skin directly into a vein a central line versus peripheral line , and in which vein the line is placed ) can be affected by the potential for some medications to cause peripheral vasoconstriction , which limits circulation to peripheral veins this may be placed in the arm , commonly either the wrist or the median cubital vein at the elbow a tourniquet may be used to restrict the venous drainage of the limb and makes the vein bulge , making it easier to locate and place a line in a vein the part of the catheter that remains outside the skin is called the connecting hub ; it can be connected to a syringe or an intravenous infusion line , or capped with a or saline lock , a needleless connection filled with a small amount of heparin or saline solution to prevent clotting , between uses of the catheter there are several types of central iv access , categorized based on the route the catheter takes from the outside of the body to the central vein output some iv lines may be placed with '' y-sites '' , devices which enable a secondary solution to be administered through the same line ( known as piggybacking ) it may occur when the vein itself ruptures , when the vein is damaged during insertion of the intravascular access device , or from increased vein porosity

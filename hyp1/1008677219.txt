intravenous ( iv ) access is used to administer medications and fluid replacement which must be distributed throughout the body , especially when rapid distribution is desired substances that may be infused intravenously include volume expanders , blood-based products , blood substitutes , medications and nutrition fluids may be administered as part of '' volume expansion '' , or fluid replacement , through the intravenous route volume expansion consists of the administration of fluid-based solutions or suspensions designed to target specific areas of the body which need more water the most commonly used crystalloid fluid is normal saline , a solution of sodium chloride at 0.9 % concentration , which is isotonic with blood buffer solutions which are used to correct acidosis or alkalosis are also administered through intravenous access lactated ringer 's solution used as a fluid expander or base solution to which medications are added also has some buffering effect another solution administered intravenously as a buffering solution is sodium bicarbonate medications may be mixed into the fluids mentioned above , commonly normal saline , or dextrose solutions compared with other route of administration , such as oral medications , the iv route is the fastest way to deliver fluids and medications throughout the body in atrial fibrillation , iv amiodarone may be administered to attempt to restore normal heart rhythm iv medications can also be used for chronic health conditions such as cancer , for which chemotherapy drugs are commonly administered intravenously the unpredictability of oral bioavailability in different people is also a reason for a medication to be administered iv - as with furosemide oral medications also may be less desirable if a person is nauseous , vomiting , or has severe diarrhea - as these may prevent the medicine from being fully absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract in these cases , a medication may be given iv only until the patient can tolerate an oral form of the medication the switch from iv to oral administration is usually performed as soon as viable , as there is generally cost and time savings over iv administration whether a medication can be potentially switched to an oral form is sometimes considered when choosing appropriate antibiotic therapy for use in a hospital setting , as a person is unlikely to be discharged if they are still requiring iv therapy blood transfusions may also be used to treat a severe anaemia or thrombocytopenia caused by a blood disease intravenous therapy is also used in people with acute ethanol toxicity to correct electrolyte and vitamin deficiencies which arise from alcohol consumption some medications are able to be administered as a bolus dose , which is called an '' iv push '' a syringe containing the medication is connected to an access port in the primary tubing and the medication is administered through the port an infusion of medication may be used when it is desirable to have a constant blood concentration of a medication over time , such as with some antibiotics including beta-lactams continuous infusions , where the next infusion is begun immediately following the completion of the prior , may also be used to limit variation in drug concentration in the blood ( i.e they may also be used instead of intermittent bolus injections for the same reason , such as with furosemide the fluid from the primary bag is needed to help flush any remaining medication from the secondary iv from the tubing secondary compatibility is generally referred to as '' y-site compatibility '' , named after the shape of the tubing which has a port for bolus administration the simplest form of intravenous access is by passing a hollow needle through the skin directly into a vein a central line versus peripheral line , and in which vein the line is placed ) can be affected by the potential for some medications to cause peripheral vasoconstriction , which limits circulation to peripheral veins this may be placed in the arm , commonly either the wrist or the median cubital vein at the elbow a tourniquet may be used to restrict the venous drainage of the limb and makes the vein bulge , making it easier to locate and place a line in a vein when used , a tourniquet should be removed before injecting medication to prevent extravasation blood samples may also be drawn from the line directly after the initial iv cannula insertion there are several types of central iv access , categorized based on the route the catheter takes from the outside of the body to the central vein output a tunneled line is a type of central access which is inserted under the skin , and then travels a significant distance through surrounding tissue before reaching and penetrating the central vein for this reason , when other forms of administration may suffice , intravenous therapy is usually not preferred a central iv line poses a higher risk of sepsis , as it can deliver bacteria directly into the central circulation it may occur when the vein itself ruptures , when the vein is damaged during insertion of the intravascular access device , or from increased vein porosity

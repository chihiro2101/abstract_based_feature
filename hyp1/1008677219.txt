intravenous ( iv ) access is used to administer medications and fluid replacement which must be distributed throughout the body , especially when rapid distribution is desired another use of iv administration is the avoidance of first-pass metabolism in the liver substances that may be infused intravenously include volume expanders , blood-based products , blood substitutes , medications and nutrition fluids may be administered as part of '' volume expansion '' , or fluid replacement , through the intravenous route the most commonly used crystalloid fluid is normal saline , a solution of sodium chloride at 0.9 % concentration , which is isotonic with blood buffer solutions which are used to correct acidosis or alkalosis are also administered through intravenous access lactated ringer 's solution used as a fluid expander or base solution to which medications are added also has some buffering effect compared with other route of administration , such as oral medications , the iv route is the fastest way to deliver fluids and medications throughout the body for this reason , the iv route is commonly preferred in emergency situations or when a fast onset of action is desirable in atrial fibrillation , iv amiodarone may be administered to attempt to restore normal heart rhythm in some cases , such as with vancomycin , a loading or bolus dose of medicine is given before beginning a dosing regimen to more quickly increase the concentration of medication in the blood the bioavailability of an iv medication is by definition 100 % , unlike oral administration where medication may not be fully absorbed , or may be metabolized prior to entering the bloodstream the unpredictability of oral bioavailability in different people is also a reason for a medication to be administered iv - as with furosemide the switch from iv to oral administration is usually performed as soon as viable , as there is generally cost and time savings over iv administration a person receiving parenteral nutrition will be given an intravenous solution which may contain salts , dextrose , amino acids , lipids and vitamins common contrast agents are administered into a peripheral vein from which they are distributed throughout the circulation to the imaging site intravenous access is also sometimes used outside of a medical setting for the self-administration of recreational drugs , such as heroin and fentanyl some medications are able to be administered as a bolus dose , which is called an '' iv push '' a syringe containing the medication is connected to an access port in the primary tubing and the medication is administered through the port a bolus may be administered rapidly ( with a fast depression of the syringe plunger ) or may be administered slowly , over the course of a few minutes in some cases , a bolus of plain iv solution ( i.e certain medications , such as potassium , are not able to be administered by iv push due to the extremely rapid onset of action and high level of effects an infusion of medication may be used when it is desirable to have a constant blood concentration of a medication over time , such as with some antibiotics including beta-lactams continuous infusions , where the next infusion is begun immediately following the completion of the prior , may also be used to limit variation in drug concentration in the blood ( i.e they may also be used instead of intermittent bolus injections for the same reason , such as with furosemide infusions can also be intermittent , in which case the medication is administered over a period of time , then stopped , and this is later repeated the fluid from the primary bag is needed to help flush any remaining medication from the secondary iv from the tubing if a bolus or secondary infusion is intended for administration in the same line as a primary infusion , the molecular compatibility of the solutions must be considered secondary compatibility is generally referred to as '' y-site compatibility '' , named after the shape of the tubing which has a port for bolus administration the simplest form of intravenous access is by passing a hollow needle through the skin directly into a vein a central line versus peripheral line , and in which vein the line is placed ) can be affected by the potential for some medications to cause peripheral vasoconstriction , which limits circulation to peripheral veins a peripheral cannula is the most common intravenous access method utilized in hospitals , pre-hospital care , and outpatient medicine a peripheral line consists of a short catheter inserted through the skin into a peripheral vein this includes the treatment of mild or moderate dehydration with oral rehydration therapy which is an option , as opposed to parenteral rehydration through an iv line certain medications also have specific sensations of pain associated with their administration iv infection of an iv access site is usually local , causing easily visible swelling , redness , and fever the presence of a cord is a cause of discomfort and pain associated with iv therapy , and makes it more difficult for an iv line to be placed as a line can not be placed in an area with a cord

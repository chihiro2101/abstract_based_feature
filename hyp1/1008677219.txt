intravenous ( iv ) access is used to administer medications and fluid replacement which must be distributed throughout the body , especially when rapid distribution is desired another use of iv administration is the avoidance of first-pass metabolism in the liver substances that may be infused intravenously include volume expanders , blood-based products , blood substitutes , medications and nutrition fluids may be administered as part of '' volume expansion '' , or fluid replacement , through the intravenous route the most commonly used crystalloid fluid is normal saline , a solution of sodium chloride at 0.9 % concentration , which is isotonic with blood buffer solutions which are used to correct acidosis or alkalosis are also administered through intravenous access lactated ringer 's solution used as a fluid expander or base solution to which medications are added also has some buffering effect compared with other route of administration , such as oral medications , the iv route is the fastest way to deliver fluids and medications throughout the body iv medications can also be used for chronic health conditions such as cancer , for which chemotherapy drugs are commonly administered intravenously the bioavailability of an iv medication is by definition 100 % , unlike oral administration where medication may not be fully absorbed , or may be metabolized prior to entering the bloodstream for this reason certain types of medications can only be given intravenously , as there is insufficient uptake by other routes of administration the unpredictability of oral bioavailability in different people is also a reason for a medication to be administered iv - as with furosemide oral medications also may be less desirable if a person is nauseous , vomiting , or has severe diarrhea - as these may prevent the medicine from being fully absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract the switch from iv to oral administration is usually performed as soon as viable , as there is generally cost and time savings over iv administration some medications , such as aprepitant , are chemically modified to be better suited for iv administration , forming a prodrug such as fosaprepitant blood transfusions may also be used to treat a severe anaemia or thrombocytopenia caused by a blood disease early blood transfusions consisted of whole blood , but modern medical practice commonly uses only components of the blood , such as packed red blood cells , fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate a person receiving parenteral nutrition will be given an intravenous solution which may contain salts , dextrose , amino acids , lipids and vitamins common contrast agents are administered into a peripheral vein from which they are distributed throughout the circulation to the imaging site intravenous therapy is also used in people with acute ethanol toxicity to correct electrolyte and vitamin deficiencies which arise from alcohol consumption some medications are able to be administered as a bolus dose , which is called an '' iv push '' in some cases , a bolus of plain iv solution ( i.e certain medications , such as potassium , are not able to be administered by iv push due to the extremely rapid onset of action and high level of effects they may also be used instead of intermittent bolus injections for the same reason , such as with furosemide infusions can also be intermittent , in which case the medication is administered over a period of time , then stopped , and this is later repeated this prevents the need to use multiple iv access lines on the same person secondary compatibility is generally referred to as '' y-site compatibility '' , named after the shape of the tubing which has a port for bolus administration incompatibility of two fluids or medications can arise due to issues of molecular stability , changes in solubility , or degradation of one of the medications a central line versus peripheral line , and in which vein the line is placed ) can be affected by the potential for some medications to cause peripheral vasoconstriction , which limits circulation to peripheral veins this may be placed in the arm , commonly either the wrist or the median cubital vein at the elbow a tourniquet may be used to restrict the venous drainage of the limb and makes the vein bulge , making it easier to locate and place a line in a vein blood samples may also be drawn from the line directly after the initial iv cannula insertion a tunneled line is a type of central access which is inserted under the skin , and then travels a significant distance through surrounding tissue before reaching and penetrating the central vein when medications are administered too rapidly through an iv line , a set of vague symptoms such as redness or rash , fever , and others may occur - this is termed an '' infusion reaction '' and is prevented by decreasing the rate of administration of the medication repeated instances of phlebitis can cause scar tissue to build up along a vein it may occur when the vein itself ruptures , when the vein is damaged during insertion of the intravascular access device , or from increased vein porosity infiltration is one of the most common adverse effects of iv therapy and is usually not serious unless the infiltrated fluid is a medication damaging to the surrounding tissue , most commonly a vesicant or chemotherapeutic agent

as the british consolidated their settlement and pushed deeper into the interior in search of mahogany in the late 18th century , they encountered resistance from the maya in the second half of the 19th century , however , a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the maya during the caste war in yucatán , a devastating struggle that halved the population of the area between 1847 and 1855 , thousands of refugees fled to the british settlement the legislative assembly had given large landowners in the colony firm titles to their vast estates in 1855 but did not allow the maya to own land nevertheless , most of the refugees were small farmers , who by 1857 were growing considerable quantities of sugar , rice , corn , and vegetables in the northern district ( now corozal and orange walk districts ) some maya who had fled the strife in the north , but had no wish to become british subjects , settled in the remote yalbac hills , just beyond the woodcutting frontier in the northwest one group of maya , led by marcos canul , attacked a mahogany camp on the bravo river in 1866 , demanding ransom for their prisoners and rent for their land early in 1867 , more than 300 british troops marched into the yalbac hills and destroyed the mayan villages , provision stores , and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district the maya returned , however , and in april 1870 , canul and his men marched into corozal and occupied the town that battle was the last serious attack on the colony in the 1880s and 1890s , mopán and kekchí maya fled from forced labour in guatemala and came to british honduras the maya could use crown lands set aside as reservations , but these people lacked communal rights under the policy of indirect rule , a system of elected alcaldes ( mayors ) , adopted from spanish local government , linked these maya to the colonial administration however , the remoteness of the area of british honduras in which they settled , combined with their largely subsistence way of life , resulted in the mopán and kekchí maya maintaining more of their traditional way of life and becoming less assimilated into the colony than the maya of the north in different ways and to different degrees , then , the maya who returned to british honduras in the 19th century became incorporated into the colony as poor and dispossessed ethnic minorities in many parts of the caribbean , large numbers of former slaves , some of whom had engaged in the cultivation and marketing of food crops , became landowners british honduras had vast areas of sparsely populated , unused land rather than the former slaves , it was the garifuna , maya and mestizos who pioneered agriculture in 19th-century british honduras these groups either rented land or lived as squatters exports of mahogany peaked at over 4 million linear metres in 1846 but fell to about 1.6 million linear meters in 1859 and 8,000 linear meters in 1870 , the lowest level since the beginning of the century major results of this depression included the decline of the old settler class , the increasing consolidation of capital and the intensification of british landownership the firm originated in a partnership between one of the old settler families and a london merchant and was registered in 1859 as a limited company the firm expanded , often at the expense of others who were forced to sell their land largely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the maya , the expenses of administering the new colony of british honduras increased , and that at a time of severe depression in the economy large landowners and merchants dominated the legislative assembly , which controlled the colony 's revenues and expenditures some of the landowners also had involvement in commerce , but their interest differed from those of the other merchants of belize town the former group resisted the taxation of land and favoured an increase in import duties ; the latter preferred the opposite moreover , the merchants in the town felt relatively secure from mayan attacks and reluctant to contribute toward the protection of mahogany camps , whereas the landowners felt that they should not be required to pay taxes on lands given inadequate protection unable to agree among themselves , the members of the legislative assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for the establishment of direct british rule in return for the greater security of crown colony status under the new constitution of 1871 , the lieutenant governor and the legislative council , consisting of five ex-officio or '' official '' and four appointed or '' unofficial '' members , governed british honduras the new company was the chief force in british honduras 's political economy for over a century by about 1890 , most commerce in british honduras was in the hands of a clique of scottish and german merchants , most of them newcomers the european minority exercised great influence in the colony 's politics , partly because it was guaranteed representation on the wholly appointed legislative council the manager of the belize estate and produce company , for example , was automatically a member of the council , while members of the emerging creole elite were excluded from holding seats on the council the creoles requested in 1890 that some seats on the council be opened to election ( as had occurred in canada and new zealand ) in the hope of winning seats , but the legislative council refused in the 1920s , the colonial office supported agitation for an elective council as long as the governor had reserve powers to allow him to push through any measures he considered essential without the council 's assent despite the prevailing stagnation of the colony 's economy and society during most of the century prior to the 1930s , seeds of change were being sown the mahogany trade remained depressed , and efforts to develop plantation agriculture in several crops , including sugarcane , coffee , cocoa , cotton , bananas and coconuts failed in 1894 mahogany workers rioted against a cut in their real wages caused by devaluation , but british troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest much of the gum was tapped in mexican and guatemalan forests by mayan chicleros who had been recruited by labour contractors in british honduras a short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the united states , but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources the introduction of tractors and bulldozers opened up new areas in the west and south in the 1920s , but this development led again to only a temporary revival in 1927 , creole merchants and professionals replaced the representatives of british landowners , ( except for the manager of the belize estate and produce company ) on the legislative council the participation of this creole elite in the political process was evidence of emerging social changes that were largely concealed by economic stagnation the colonial report for 1931 stated that '' contracts for the purchase of mahogany and chicle , which form the mainstay of the colony , practically ceased altogether , thereby throwing a large number of the woodcutters and chicle-gatherers out of work '' the british government seized the opportunity to impose tighter control on the colony and endowed the governor with reserve powers , or the power to enact laws in emergency situations without the consent of the legislative council the legislative council resisted but eventually passed a resolution agreeing to give the governor reserve powers to obtain disaster aid since 1875 various members of the hoare family had been principal directors and maintained a controlling interest in the company the british government rescued the company by granting it an area of virgin mahogany forest and a loan of us 200,000 to erect a sawmill in belize town then , in october , the governor charged belize billboard publishers and owners , including richardson and goldson , with sedition from 1749 until 1884 , british honduras was governed as a dependency of the british colony of jamaica the confederate settlements in british honduras introduced large-scale sugar production to the colony and proved that it could be profitable where others had previously failed list of colonial governors and administrators of british honduras attorney general of belize chief justice of belize

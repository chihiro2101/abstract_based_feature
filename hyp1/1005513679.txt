as the british consolidated their settlement and pushed deeper into the interior in search of mahogany in the late 18th century , they encountered resistance from the maya in the second half of the 19th century , however , a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the maya the legislative assembly had given large landowners in the colony firm titles to their vast estates in 1855 but did not allow the maya to own land nevertheless , most of the refugees were small farmers , who by 1857 were growing considerable quantities of sugar , rice , corn , and vegetables in the northern district ( now corozal and orange walk districts ) in 1857 , the town of corozal , then six years old , had 4,500 inhabitants , second in population only to belize town , which had 7,000 inhabitants some maya who had fled the strife in the north , but had no wish to become british subjects , settled in the remote yalbac hills , just beyond the woodcutting frontier in the northwest one group of maya , led by marcos canul , attacked a mahogany camp on the bravo river in 1866 , demanding ransom for their prisoners and rent for their land early in 1867 , more than 300 british troops marched into the yalbac hills and destroyed the mayan villages , provision stores , and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district the maya returned , however , and in april 1870 , canul and his men marched into corozal and occupied the town in the 1880s and 1890s , mopán and kekchí maya fled from forced labour in guatemala and came to british honduras under the policy of indirect rule , a system of elected alcaldes ( mayors ) , adopted from spanish local government , linked these maya to the colonial administration however , the remoteness of the area of british honduras in which they settled , combined with their largely subsistence way of life , resulted in the mopán and kekchí maya maintaining more of their traditional way of life and becoming less assimilated into the colony than the maya of the north in many parts of the caribbean , large numbers of former slaves , some of whom had engaged in the cultivation and marketing of food crops , became landowners rather than the former slaves , it was the garifuna , maya and mestizos who pioneered agriculture in 19th-century british honduras however , the domination of the land by forestry interests continued to stifle agriculture and kept much of the population dependent on imported foods mahogany and logwood continued to account for over 80 percent of the total value of exports , but the price of these goods was so low that the economy was in a state of prolonged depression after the 1850s major results of this depression included the decline of the old settler class , the increasing consolidation of capital and the intensification of british landownership the british honduras company emerged as the predominant landowner of the crown colony the firm originated in a partnership between one of the old settler families and a london merchant and was registered in 1859 as a limited company largely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the maya , the expenses of administering the new colony of british honduras increased , and that at a time of severe depression in the economy some of the landowners also had involvement in commerce , but their interest differed from those of the other merchants of belize town these conflicting interests produced a stalemate in the legislative assembly , which failed to authorise the raising of sufficient revenue unable to agree among themselves , the members of the legislative assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for the establishment of direct british rule in return for the greater security of crown colony status under the new constitution of 1871 , the lieutenant governor and the legislative council , consisting of five ex-officio or '' official '' and four appointed or '' unofficial '' members , governed british honduras the change moved power from the old settler oligarchy to the boardrooms of british companies and to the colonial office in london in 1875 , the british honduras company became the belize estate and produce company , a london-based business that owned about half of all the privately held land in the colony it also signalled the eclipse of the old settler elite this clique encouraged consumption of imported goods and thus furthered british honduras 's dependence on britain in 1892 , the governor appointed several creole members , but whites remained the majority in 1919 demobilised creole servicemen protested british racism , but british troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest , which was indicative of discontent but had little lasting effect despite the prevailing stagnation of the colony 's economy and society during most of the century prior to the 1930s , seeds of change were being sown a brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the united states exports of chicle , a gum taken from the sapodilla tree and used to make chewing gum , propped up the economy from the 1880s much of the gum was tapped in mexican and guatemalan forests by mayan chicleros who had been recruited by labour contractors in british honduras at this time , mahogany , cedar and chicle together accounted for 97 percent of forest production and 82 percent of the total value of exports melhado , whose merchant family dealt in illicit liquor during prohibition , became major political and economic figures the colonial report for 1931 stated that '' contracts for the purchase of mahogany and chicle , which form the mainstay of the colony , practically ceased altogether , thereby throwing a large number of the woodcutters and chicle-gatherers out of work '' on top of this economic disaster , the 1931 belize hurricane demolished belize town on 10 september 1931 , killing more than 1,000 people and destroying at least three-quarters of the housing the british relief response was tardy and inadequate the british government seized the opportunity to impose tighter control on the colony and endowed the governor with reserve powers , or the power to enact laws in emergency situations without the consent of the legislative council since 1875 various members of the hoare family had been principal directors and maintained a controlling interest in the company the british government rescued the company by granting it an area of virgin mahogany forest and a loan of us 200,000 to erect a sawmill in belize town when the government almost doubled the land tax , the large landowners refused to pay brown , the expatriate manager of the company , in the first elections for some of the legislative council seats in 1936 in 1931 the governor , sir john burdon , rejected proposals to legalise trade unions and to introduce a minimum wage and sickness insurance the conditions , aggravated by rising unemployment and the disastrous hurricane , were responsible for severe hardship among the poor the governor also offered a daily ration of two kilograms of cooked rice at the prison gates it was a decade during which the old phenomena of exploitative labour conditions and authoritarian colonial and industrial relations began to give way to new labour and political processes and institutions at the centre of guatemala 's oldest claim was the 1859 treaty between the united kingdom and guatemala from britain 's viewpoint , this treaty merely settled the boundaries of an area already under british dominion in february 1948 , guatemala threatened to invade and forcibly annex the territory , and the british responded by deploying two companies from 2nd battalion gloucestershire regiment government of belize website belize at the commonwealth u.s library of congress country study '' a history of belize ''

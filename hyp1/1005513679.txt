in the second half of the 19th century , however , a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the maya during the caste war in yucatán , a devastating struggle that halved the population of the area between 1847 and 1855 , thousands of refugees fled to the british settlement in 1857 , the town of corozal , then six years old , had 4,500 inhabitants , second in population only to belize town , which had 7,000 inhabitants by 1862 , about 1,000 maya established themselves in 10 villages in this area , with the center in san pedro a detachment of british troops sent to san pedro was defeated by the maya later that year early in 1867 , more than 300 british troops marched into the yalbac hills and destroyed the mayan villages , provision stores , and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district they settled in several villages in southern british honduras , mainly around san antonio in toledo district . formal establishment of the colony , 1862–1871 the forestry industry 's control of land and its influence in colonial decision making hindered the development of agriculture and the diversification of the economy british honduras had vast areas of sparsely populated , unused land however , the domination of the land by forestry interests continued to stifle agriculture and kept much of the population dependent on imported foods landownership became even more consolidated during the economic depression of the mid-19th century exports of mahogany peaked at over 4 million linear metres in 1846 but fell to about 1.6 million linear meters in 1859 and 8,000 linear meters in 1870 , the lowest level since the beginning of the century mahogany and logwood continued to account for over 80 percent of the total value of exports , but the price of these goods was so low that the economy was in a state of prolonged depression after the 1850s the british honduras company emerged as the predominant landowner of the crown colony the firm originated in a partnership between one of the old settler families and a london merchant and was registered in 1859 as a limited company the firm expanded , often at the expense of others who were forced to sell their land largely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the maya , the expenses of administering the new colony of british honduras increased , and that at a time of severe depression in the economy large landowners and merchants dominated the legislative assembly , which controlled the colony 's revenues and expenditures some of the landowners also had involvement in commerce , but their interest differed from those of the other merchants of belize town unable to agree among themselves , the members of the legislative assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for the establishment of direct british rule in return for the greater security of crown colony status the new constitution was inaugurated in april 1871 and the legislative council became the new legislature this constitutional change confirmed and completed a change in the locus and form of power in the colony 's political economy that had evolved during the preceding half-century the change moved power from the old settler oligarchy to the boardrooms of british companies and to the colonial office in london in 1875 , the british honduras company became the belize estate and produce company , a london-based business that owned about half of all the privately held land in the colony this concentration and centralisation of capital meant that the direction of the colony 's economy was henceforth determined largely in london this clique encouraged consumption of imported goods and thus furthered british honduras 's dependence on britain the european minority exercised great influence in the colony 's politics , partly because it was guaranteed representation on the wholly appointed legislative council but the council rejected these provisos , and the issue of restoring elections was postponed in 1894 mahogany workers rioted against a cut in their real wages caused by devaluation , but british troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest much of the gum was tapped in mexican and guatemalan forests by mayan chicleros who had been recruited by labour contractors in british honduras a short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the united states , but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources the introduction of tractors and bulldozers opened up new areas in the west and south in the 1920s , but this development led again to only a temporary revival the economy , which was increasingly oriented toward trade with the united states , remained dependent and underdeveloped creoles , who were well-connected with businesses in the united states , challenged the traditional political-economic connection with britain as trade with the united states intensified in 1927 , creole merchants and professionals replaced the representatives of british landowners , ( except for the manager of the belize estate and produce company ) on the legislative council the great depression shattered the colony 's economy , and unemployment increased rapidly the colonial report for 1931 stated that '' contracts for the purchase of mahogany and chicle , which form the mainstay of the colony , practically ceased altogether , thereby throwing a large number of the woodcutters and chicle-gatherers out of work '' on top of this economic disaster , the 1931 belize hurricane demolished belize town on 10 september 1931 , killing more than 1,000 people and destroying at least three-quarters of the housing the british relief response was tardy and inadequate the british government seized the opportunity to impose tighter control on the colony and endowed the governor with reserve powers , or the power to enact laws in emergency situations without the consent of the legislative council meanwhile , people in the town were making shelters out of the wreckage of their houses the belize estate and produce company survived the depression years because of its special connections in british honduras and london since 1875 various members of the hoare family had been principal directors and maintained a controlling interest in the company in 1931 , when the company was suffering from the aftereffects of the hurricane and the depression , family member oliver v.g hoare contacted the colonial office to discuss the possibility of selling the company to buyers in the united states the british government rescued the company by granting it an area of virgin mahogany forest and a loan of us 200,000 to erect a sawmill in belize town brown , the expatriate manager of the company , in the first elections for some of the legislative council seats in 1936 a year later , george price , the secretary of the pup , became vice-president of the gwu then , in october , the governor charged belize billboard publishers and owners , including richardson and goldson , with sedition in february 1948 , guatemala threatened to invade and forcibly annex the territory , and the british responded by deploying two companies from 2nd battalion gloucestershire regiment from 1749 until 1884 , british honduras was governed as a dependency of the british colony of jamaica list of colonial governors and administrators of british honduras attorney general of

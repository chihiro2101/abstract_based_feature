as the british consolidated their settlement and pushed deeper into the interior in search of mahogany in the late 18th century , they encountered resistance from the maya in the second half of the 19th century , however , a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the maya in 1857 , the town of corozal , then six years old , had 4,500 inhabitants , second in population only to belize town , which had 7,000 inhabitants a detachment of british troops sent to san pedro was defeated by the maya later that year early in 1867 , more than 300 british troops marched into the yalbac hills and destroyed the mayan villages , provision stores , and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district in the 1880s and 1890s , mopán and kekchí maya fled from forced labour in guatemala and came to british honduras the maya could use crown lands set aside as reservations , but these people lacked communal rights however , the remoteness of the area of british honduras in which they settled , combined with their largely subsistence way of life , resulted in the mopán and kekchí maya maintaining more of their traditional way of life and becoming less assimilated into the colony than the maya of the north in different ways and to different degrees , then , the maya who returned to british honduras in the 19th century became incorporated into the colony as poor and dispossessed ethnic minorities in many parts of the caribbean , large numbers of former slaves , some of whom had engaged in the cultivation and marketing of food crops , became landowners british honduras had vast areas of sparsely populated , unused land nevertheless , land ownership was controlled by a small european monopoly , thwarting the evolution of a creole landowning class from the former slaves however , the domination of the land by forestry interests continued to stifle agriculture and kept much of the population dependent on imported foods major results of this depression included the decline of the old settler class , the increasing consolidation of capital and the intensification of british landownership the firm expanded , often at the expense of others who were forced to sell their land largely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the maya , the expenses of administering the new colony of british honduras increased , and that at a time of severe depression in the economy large landowners and merchants dominated the legislative assembly , which controlled the colony 's revenues and expenditures some of the landowners also had involvement in commerce , but their interest differed from those of the other merchants of belize town these conflicting interests produced a stalemate in the legislative assembly , which failed to authorise the raising of sufficient revenue . colonial order , 1871–1931 under the new constitution of 1871 , the lieutenant governor and the legislative council , consisting of five ex-officio or '' official '' and four appointed or '' unofficial '' members , governed british honduras the change moved power from the old settler oligarchy to the boardrooms of british companies and to the colonial office in london in 1875 , the british honduras company became the belize estate and produce company , a london-based business that owned about half of all the privately held land in the colony the new company was the chief force in british honduras 's political economy for over a century this clique encouraged consumption of imported goods and thus furthered british honduras 's dependence on britain the european minority exercised great influence in the colony 's politics , partly because it was guaranteed representation on the wholly appointed legislative council the manager of the belize estate and produce company , for example , was automatically a member of the council , while members of the emerging creole elite were excluded from holding seats on the council the creoles requested in 1890 that some seats on the council be opened to election ( as had occurred in canada and new zealand ) in the hope of winning seats , but the legislative council refused in 1919 demobilised creole servicemen protested british racism , but british troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest , which was indicative of discontent but had little lasting effect despite the prevailing stagnation of the colony 's economy and society during most of the century prior to the 1930s , seeds of change were being sown a brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the united states exports of chicle , a gum taken from the sapodilla tree and used to make chewing gum , propped up the economy from the 1880s much of the gum was tapped in mexican and guatemalan forests by mayan chicleros who had been recruited by labour contractors in british honduras melhado , whose merchant family dealt in illicit liquor during prohibition , became major political and economic figures in 1927 , creole merchants and professionals replaced the representatives of british landowners , ( except for the manager of the belize estate and produce company ) on the legislative council the colonial report for 1931 stated that '' contracts for the purchase of mahogany and chicle , which form the mainstay of the colony , practically ceased altogether , thereby throwing a large number of the woodcutters and chicle-gatherers out of work '' the british government seized the opportunity to impose tighter control on the colony and endowed the governor with reserve powers , or the power to enact laws in emergency situations without the consent of the legislative council the legislative council resisted but eventually passed a resolution agreeing to give the governor reserve powers to obtain disaster aid meanwhile , people in the town were making shelters out of the wreckage of their houses the belize estate and produce company survived the depression years because of its special connections in british honduras and london since 1875 various members of the hoare family had been principal directors and maintained a controlling interest in the company brown , the expatriate manager of the company , in the first elections for some of the legislative council seats in 1936 meanwhile , the belize estate and produce company drove maya villagers from their homes in san jose and yalbac in the northwest and treated workers in mahogany camps almost like slaves in 1931 the governor , sir john burdon , rejected proposals to legalise trade unions and to introduce a minimum wage and sickness insurance a group calling itself the unemployed brigade marched through belize town on 14 february 1934 , to present demands to the governor and started a broad movement the governor also offered a daily ration of two kilograms of cooked rice at the prison gates finally , in 1954 british honduras achieved suffrage for all literate adults as a result of the emerging independence movement in july 1951 , the governor dissolved the belize city council on the pretext that it had shown disloyalty by refusing to display a picture of king george vi the territorial dispute 's origins lay in the 18th-century treaties in which great britain acceded to spain 's assertion of sovereignty while british settlers continued to occupy the sparsely settled and ill-defined area before 1884 the colonial administration of british honduras was rather haphazard from 1749 until 1884 , british honduras was governed as a dependency of the british colony of jamaica the confederate settlements in british honduras introduced large-scale sugar production to the colony and proved that it could be profitable where others had previously failed library of congress country study '' a history of belize '' at naturalight productions ' belize tourism website jesuit mission

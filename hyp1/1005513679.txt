as the british consolidated their settlement and pushed deeper into the interior in search of mahogany in the late 18th century , they encountered resistance from the maya in the second half of the 19th century , however , a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the maya during the caste war in yucatán , a devastating struggle that halved the population of the area between 1847 and 1855 , thousands of refugees fled to the british settlement the legislative assembly had given large landowners in the colony firm titles to their vast estates in 1855 but did not allow the maya to own land some maya who had fled the strife in the north , but had no wish to become british subjects , settled in the remote yalbac hills , just beyond the woodcutting frontier in the northwest a detachment of british troops sent to san pedro was defeated by the maya later that year early in 1867 , more than 300 british troops marched into the yalbac hills and destroyed the mayan villages , provision stores , and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district in the 1880s and 1890s , mopán and kekchí maya fled from forced labour in guatemala and came to british honduras they settled in several villages in southern british honduras , mainly around san antonio in toledo district the maya could use crown lands set aside as reservations , but these people lacked communal rights under the policy of indirect rule , a system of elected alcaldes ( mayors ) , adopted from spanish local government , linked these maya to the colonial administration in different ways and to different degrees , then , the maya who returned to british honduras in the 19th century became incorporated into the colony as poor and dispossessed ethnic minorities . formal establishment of the colony , 1862–1871 british honduras had vast areas of sparsely populated , unused land however , the domination of the land by forestry interests continued to stifle agriculture and kept much of the population dependent on imported foods exports of mahogany peaked at over 4 million linear metres in 1846 but fell to about 1.6 million linear meters in 1859 and 8,000 linear meters in 1870 , the lowest level since the beginning of the century the british honduras company emerged as the predominant landowner of the crown colony the firm originated in a partnership between one of the old settler families and a london merchant and was registered in 1859 as a limited company large landowners and merchants dominated the legislative assembly , which controlled the colony 's revenues and expenditures these conflicting interests produced a stalemate in the legislative assembly , which failed to authorise the raising of sufficient revenue unable to agree among themselves , the members of the legislative assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for the establishment of direct british rule in return for the greater security of crown colony status under the new constitution of 1871 , the lieutenant governor and the legislative council , consisting of five ex-officio or '' official '' and four appointed or '' unofficial '' members , governed british honduras the change moved power from the old settler oligarchy to the boardrooms of british companies and to the colonial office in london in 1875 , the british honduras company became the belize estate and produce company , a london-based business that owned about half of all the privately held land in the colony the new company was the chief force in british honduras 's political economy for over a century by about 1890 , most commerce in british honduras was in the hands of a clique of scottish and german merchants , most of them newcomers this clique encouraged consumption of imported goods and thus furthered british honduras 's dependence on britain the manager of the belize estate and produce company , for example , was automatically a member of the council , while members of the emerging creole elite were excluded from holding seats on the council in 1919 demobilised creole servicemen protested british racism , but british troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest , which was indicative of discontent but had little lasting effect a brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the united states the introduction of tractors and bulldozers opened up new areas in the west and south in the 1920s , but this development led again to only a temporary revival on top of this economic disaster , the 1931 belize hurricane demolished belize town on 10 september 1931 , killing more than 1,000 people and destroying at least three-quarters of the housing the british relief response was tardy and inadequate the british government seized the opportunity to impose tighter control on the colony and endowed the governor with reserve powers , or the power to enact laws in emergency situations without the consent of the legislative council the legislative council resisted but eventually passed a resolution agreeing to give the governor reserve powers to obtain disaster aid meanwhile , people in the town were making shelters out of the wreckage of their houses in 1931 , when the company was suffering from the aftereffects of the hurricane and the depression , family member oliver v.g hoare contacted the colonial office to discuss the possibility of selling the company to buyers in the united states the british government rescued the company by granting it an area of virgin mahogany forest and a loan of us 200,000 to erect a sawmill in belize town when the government almost doubled the land tax , the large landowners refused to pay robert turton , the creole millionaire who made his fortune from chicle exports , defeated c.h after the elections , the governor promptly appointed brown to the council , presumably to maintain the influence of what had for so long been the colony 's chief business but brown 's defeat by turton , one of the company 's chief local business rivals , marked the decline of old british enterprises in relation to the rising creole entrepreneurs with their united states commercial connections meanwhile , the belize estate and produce company drove maya villagers from their homes in san jose and yalbac in the northwest and treated workers in mahogany camps almost like slaves riots , strikes and rebellions had occurred before , during and after the period of slavery , but the events of the 1930s were modern labour disturbances in the sense that they gave rise to organisations with articulate industrial and political goals a group calling itself the unemployed brigade marched through belize town on 14 february 1934 , to present demands to the governor and started a broad movement furthermore , the penal clauses of the old masters and servants act rendered the new rights ineffectual in 1947 a group of graduates of the elite catholic saint john 's college formed the csag and won control of the belize city council even after belize became independent in 1981 , however , the territorial dispute remained unsettled finally , in november 1980 , with guatemala completely isolated , the un passed a resolution that demanded the independence of belize , with all its territory intact , before the next session of the un in 1981 exports of mahogany continued as an economic mainstay , as commercial agriculture remained unprofitable due to unfavourable colonial tax

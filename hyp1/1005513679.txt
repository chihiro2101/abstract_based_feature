as the british consolidated their settlement and pushed deeper into the interior in search of mahogany in the late 18th century , they encountered resistance from the maya in the second half of the 19th century , however , a combination of events outside and inside the colony redefined the position of the maya during the caste war in yucatán , a devastating struggle that halved the population of the area between 1847 and 1855 , thousands of refugees fled to the british settlement the legislative assembly had given large landowners in the colony firm titles to their vast estates in 1855 but did not allow the maya to own land some maya who had fled the strife in the north , but had no wish to become british subjects , settled in the remote yalbac hills , just beyond the woodcutting frontier in the northwest early in 1867 , more than 300 british troops marched into the yalbac hills and destroyed the mayan villages , provision stores , and granaries in an attempt to drive them out of the district the maya returned , however , and in april 1870 , canul and his men marched into corozal and occupied the town in the 1880s and 1890s , mopán and kekchí maya fled from forced labour in guatemala and came to british honduras they settled in several villages in southern british honduras , mainly around san antonio in toledo district under the policy of indirect rule , a system of elected alcaldes ( mayors ) , adopted from spanish local government , linked these maya to the colonial administration but in the north , the distinction between maya and spanish was increasingly blurred , and a mestizo culture emerged in different ways and to different degrees , then , the maya who returned to british honduras in the 19th century became incorporated into the colony as poor and dispossessed ethnic minorities the forestry industry 's control of land and its influence in colonial decision making hindered the development of agriculture and the diversification of the economy in many parts of the caribbean , large numbers of former slaves , some of whom had engaged in the cultivation and marketing of food crops , became landowners the british honduras company emerged as the predominant landowner of the crown colony largely as a result of the costly military expeditions against the maya , the expenses of administering the new colony of british honduras increased , and that at a time of severe depression in the economy large landowners and merchants dominated the legislative assembly , which controlled the colony 's revenues and expenditures some of the landowners also had involvement in commerce , but their interest differed from those of the other merchants of belize town unable to agree among themselves , the members of the legislative assembly surrendered their political privileges and asked for the establishment of direct british rule in return for the greater security of crown colony status under the new constitution of 1871 , the lieutenant governor and the legislative council , consisting of five ex-officio or '' official '' and four appointed or '' unofficial '' members , governed british honduras this constitutional change confirmed and completed a change in the locus and form of power in the colony 's political economy that had evolved during the preceding half-century the change moved power from the old settler oligarchy to the boardrooms of british companies and to the colonial office in london in 1875 , the british honduras company became the belize estate and produce company , a london-based business that owned about half of all the privately held land in the colony it also signalled the eclipse of the old settler elite this clique encouraged consumption of imported goods and thus furthered british honduras 's dependence on britain the european minority exercised great influence in the colony 's politics , partly because it was guaranteed representation on the wholly appointed legislative council in 1919 demobilised creole servicemen protested british racism , but british troops soon stopped this spontaneous protest , which was indicative of discontent but had little lasting effect in the 1920s , the colonial office supported agitation for an elective council as long as the governor had reserve powers to allow him to push through any measures he considered essential without the council 's assent despite the prevailing stagnation of the colony 's economy and society during most of the century prior to the 1930s , seeds of change were being sown a brief revival in the forestry industry took place early in the 20th century as new demands for forest products came from the united states much of the gum was tapped in mexican and guatemalan forests by mayan chicleros who had been recruited by labour contractors in british honduras a short-lived boom in the mahogany trade occurred around 1900 in response to growing demand for the wood in the united states , but the ruthless exploitation of the forests without any conservation or reforestation depleted resources the economy , which was increasingly oriented toward trade with the united states , remained dependent and underdeveloped creoles , who were well-connected with businesses in the united states , challenged the traditional political-economic connection with britain as trade with the united states intensified turton , the creole chicle buyer for wrigley 's , and henry i melhado , whose merchant family dealt in illicit liquor during prohibition , became major political and economic figures in 1927 , creole merchants and professionals replaced the representatives of british landowners , ( except for the manager of the belize estate and produce company ) on the legislative council the participation of this creole elite in the political process was evidence of emerging social changes that were largely concealed by economic stagnation the great depression shattered the colony 's economy , and unemployment increased rapidly on top of this economic disaster , the 1931 belize hurricane demolished belize town on 10 september 1931 , killing more than 1,000 people and destroying at least three-quarters of the housing the total value of imports and exports in the latter year was little more than one-fourth of what it had been in 1929 sir samuel hoare , a shareholder and former director , had been a british cabinet member and a friend of leo amery , the british secretary of state for the colonies in 1931 , when the company was suffering from the aftereffects of the hurricane and the depression , family member oliver v.g hoare contacted the colonial office to discuss the possibility of selling the company to buyers in the united states the british government rescued the company by granting it an area of virgin mahogany forest and a loan of us 200,000 to erect a sawmill in belize town when the government almost doubled the land tax , the large landowners refused to pay brown , the expatriate manager of the company , in the first elections for some of the legislative council seats in 1936 after the elections , the governor promptly appointed brown to the council , presumably to maintain the influence of what had for so long been the colony 's chief business on 29 september 1950 , the people 's committee was dissolved and the people 's united party ( pup ) formed in its place in its constitution of 1945 , however , guatemala stated that british honduras was the twenty-third department of guatemala all parties in british honduras , however , denounced the proposals a set of regulations called '' burnaby 's code '' was adopted in 1765 , which continued in force until 1840 , when an executive council was created by the time of the colony 's 1790 census , three-quarters of the population of british honduras were a mixed-race people known as '' creole people ''

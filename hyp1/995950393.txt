the mistle thrush was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name turdus is the latin for '' thrush '' , and viscivorus , '' mistletoe eater '' , comes from viscum '' mistletoe '' and vorare , '' to devour '' the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant there are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus turdus , characterised by rounded heads , longish pointed wings , and usually melodious songs at least eight subspecies have been proposed , but the differences between them are mainly clinal , with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range the mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to europe it has pale grey-brown upperparts , the chin and throat are greyish-white , and the yellowish-buff breast and off-white belly are marked with round black spots there are no plumage differences between the sexes juveniles are similar to adults , but they have paler upperparts with creamy centres to many of the feathers and smaller spots on the yellowish underparts by their first winter they are very similar to adults , but the underparts are usually more buff-toned bonapartei is in length , and therefore slightly larger than the nominate form it is paler grey above and whiter below , with fewer black spots adults have a full moult after breeding , beginning between late may and the end of june , and completed by early october the mistle thrush is much larger , paler and longer-tailed than the sympatric song thrush juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to white 's thrush , but that species has golden-yellow plumage , scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern the male mistle thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles , sounding like chewee-trewuu & nbsp ; the tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird , but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush 's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower the mistle thrush breeds in much of europe and temperate asia , although it is absent from the treeless far north , and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast europe , turkey and the middle east the mistle thrush is a partial migrant : birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of europe and north africa in the himalayas , the breeding population moves to nearby lower-altitude sites in winter migration may be by day or night , and typically involves individuals or small groups in the winter 2017/2018 the first record of a mistle thrush for north america was at miramichi in new brunswick in the south and east of its range , it inhabits upland coniferous woodland and the range extends above the main tree line where dwarf juniper is present in areas of intensive farming , such as eastern england , arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats perhaps the most notable find of the 118th christmas bird count in canada was a single vagrant mistle thrush found in miramichi , new brunswick they roost at night in trees or bushes , again typically as individuals or pairs , except in late summer or autumn when families may roost together the mistle thrush is quite terrestrial , hopping with its head held up and body erect ; when excited , it will flick its wings and tail mistle thrushes breed in the year subsequent to their hatching ; they are monogamous and stay as a pair throughout the year in areas where they are not migratory their territories are much larger than those of blackbirds or song thrushes ; although the nest territory is only about , around is used for feeding the male will attack intruders into its breeding area , including birds of prey and corvids , and sometimes cats or humans breeding typically commences in mid-march in the south and west of europe ( late february in britain ) , but not till early may in finland the nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk , although hedges , ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used the common chaffinch often nests close to a mistle thrush , the vigilance of the chaffinch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species the mistle thrush has been known to kill slowworms and the young of the song thrush , blackbird and dunnock given its high numbers and very large range , this thrush is therefore classified by the international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern '' holm thrush '' , '' hollin cock '' and '' holm cock '' are based on obsolete names for the holly tree , which may be defended by the thrush in winter for its berries

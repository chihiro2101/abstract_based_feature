the mistle thrush was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name turdus is the latin for '' thrush '' , and viscivorus , '' mistletoe eater '' , comes from viscum '' mistletoe '' and vorare , '' to devour '' the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant there are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus turdus , characterised by rounded heads , longish pointed wings , and usually melodious songs they are less closely related to other european thrush species such as the blackbird ( t at least eight subspecies have been proposed , but the differences between them are mainly clinal , with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range the mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to europe the nominate subspecies measures in length , with a wingspan the spotting becomes denser on the lower chest , giving the appearance of a breast-band the mistle thrush is much larger , paler and longer-tailed than the sympatric song thrush the long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts , bars on its breast and two wing bars juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to white 's thrush , but that species has golden-yellow plumage , scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern the male mistle thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles , sounding like chewee-trewuu & nbsp ; the song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from november to early june the main call , given by both sexes , is a dry chattering krrrr , louder when it is alarmed or excited the mistle thrush breeds in much of europe and temperate asia , although it is absent from the treeless far north , and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast europe , turkey and the middle east in these warmer southern areas , it tends to be found in the milder uplands and coastal regions the mistle thrush is a partial migrant : birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of europe and north africa scandinavian and russian birds start moving south from mid-september onwards , most birds wintering in europe , western turkey and the middle east breeding birds in the british isles and north-west europe are resident or move only short distances return migration starts mainly from late march , although it can be a month earlier in the middle east , and northern breeders may not arrive back on their territories until late april or early may migration may be by day or night , and typically involves individuals or small groups the mistle thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees , including forests , plantations , hedges and town parks breeding occurs at up to in the mountains of north africa , and occasionally much higher , to more open habitats , such as agricultural land , moors and grassy hills , are extensively used in winter or on migration in germany and elsewhere in central europe , it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded , first into farmland , and then to suburbs and urban parks fuller ( 2003 ) p in areas of intensive farming , such as eastern england , arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats they roost at night in trees or bushes , again typically as individuals or pairs , except in late summer or autumn when families may roost together the mistle thrush is quite terrestrial , hopping with its head held up and body erect ; when excited , it will flick its wings and tail the nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk , although hedges , ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used animal prey include earthworms , insects and other arthropods , slugs and snails as its name implies , the mistle thrush is important in propagating the mistletoe , an aerial parasite , which needs its seeds to be deposited on the branches of suitable trees the mistle thrush has an extensive distribution in europe and western asia , and its european breeding population is estimated at 9â€“22.2 & nbsp ; million birds the species was formerly more restricted in range , and rarely bred even in northern england in the 1700s the song of the mistle thrush is also described in thomas hardy 's '' darkling thrush '' and edward thomas 's '' the thrush ''

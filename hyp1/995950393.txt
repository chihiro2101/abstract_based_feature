the mistle thrush was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name turdus is the latin for '' thrush '' , and viscivorus , '' mistletoe eater '' , comes from viscum '' mistletoe '' and vorare , '' to devour '' the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant there are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus turdus , characterised by rounded heads , longish pointed wings , and usually melodious songs a mitochondrial dna study identified the mistle thrush 's closest relatives as the similarly plumaged song and chinese thrushes ; these three species are early offshoots from the eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa they are less closely related to other european thrush species such as the blackbird ( t at least eight subspecies have been proposed , but the differences between them are mainly clinal , with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range turdus viscivorus viscivorus , named by linnaeus , 1758 , the nominate subspecies mistle thrush fossils have been found in pleistocene deposits from poland and sicily it has pale grey-brown upperparts , the chin and throat are greyish-white , and the yellowish-buff breast and off-white belly are marked with round black spots the eyes are dark brown and the bill is blackish with a yellowish base to the lower mandible the mistle thrush is much larger , paler and longer-tailed than the sympatric song thrush the long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts , bars on its breast and two wing bars juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to white 's thrush , but that species has golden-yellow plumage , scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern trureetruuruu or similar , repeated three to six times , and used to advertise his territory , attract a mate and maintain the pair bond the tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird , but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush 's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower the song is , however , much louder , often audible up to 2 & nbsp ; km ( 2,000 & nbsp ; yd ) away there is also a squeaky tuk contact call the mistle thrush breeds in much of europe and temperate asia , although it is absent from the treeless far north , and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast europe , turkey and the middle east the mistle thrush is a partial migrant : birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of europe and north africa breeding birds in the british isles and north-west europe are resident or move only short distances migration may be by day or night , and typically involves individuals or small groups in the winter 2017/2018 the first record of a mistle thrush for north america was at miramichi in new brunswick the mistle thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees , including forests , plantations , hedges and town parks in the south and east of its range , it inhabits upland coniferous woodland and the range extends above the main tree line where dwarf juniper is present breeding occurs at up to in the mountains of north africa , and occasionally much higher , to there is evidence that this species has changed its natural habitat in at least parts of its range the reasons for this expansion are unclear perhaps the most notable find of the 118th christmas bird count in canada was a single vagrant mistle thrush found in miramichi , new brunswick the discovery attracted many birders from canada and the united states ; sightings continued from early december 2017 through late march 2018 although the thrush normally feeds on the ground and from low bushes , the defence of this resource conserves fruit for later in the season when other food items become scarce in milder winters with an abundance of fruit , however , this strategy is less used and thrushes can be observed foraging in flocks the mistle thrush has an extensive distribution in europe and western asia , and its european breeding population is estimated at 9â€“22.2 & nbsp ; million birds given its high numbers and very large range , this thrush is therefore classified by the international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern the song of the mistle thrush is also described in thomas hardy 's '' darkling thrush '' and edward thomas 's '' the thrush '' '' stormcock , released in 1971 , is the fifth album by english folk/rock singer-songwriter and guitarist roy harper

the mistle thrush was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name turdus is the latin for '' thrush '' , and viscivorus , '' mistletoe eater '' , comes from viscum '' mistletoe '' and vorare , '' to devour '' the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant there are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus turdus , characterised by rounded heads , longish pointed wings , and usually melodious songs a mitochondrial dna study identified the mistle thrush 's closest relatives as the similarly plumaged song and chinese thrushes ; these three species are early offshoots from the eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa they are less closely related to other european thrush species such as the blackbird ( t merula ) which are descended from ancestors that had colonised the caribbean islands from africa and subsequently reached europe from there turdus viscivorus viscivorus , named by linnaeus , 1758 , the nominate subspecies mistle thrush fossils have been found in pleistocene deposits from poland and sicily the mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to europe juveniles are similar to adults , but they have paler upperparts with creamy centres to many of the feathers and smaller spots on the yellowish underparts adults have a full moult after breeding , beginning between late may and the end of june , and completed by early october the mistle thrush is much larger , paler and longer-tailed than the sympatric song thrush in the western himalayas it could be confused with both the plain-backed and the long-tailed thrushes juvenile mistle thrushes are superficially similar to white 's thrush , but that species has golden-yellow plumage , scalloped underparts and a distinctive underwing pattern the male mistle thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles , sounding like chewee-trewuu & nbsp ; trureetruuruu or similar , repeated three to six times , and used to advertise his territory , attract a mate and maintain the pair bond the tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird , but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush 's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower the song is , however , much louder , often audible up to 2 & nbsp ; km ( 2,000 & nbsp ; yd ) away the song is given from a treetop or other elevated position mainly from november to early june the male is most vocal in the early morning , and its tendency to sing after , and sometimes during , wet and windy weather led to the old name '' stormcock '' the mistle thrush breeds in much of europe and temperate asia , although it is absent from the treeless far north , and its range becomes discontinuous in southeast europe , turkey and the middle east in these warmer southern areas , it tends to be found in the milder uplands and coastal regions viscivorus breeds in europe and in asia east to the ob , beyond which it is replaced by t the mistle thrush is a partial migrant : birds from the north and east of the range wintering in the milder areas of europe and north africa scandinavian and russian birds start moving south from mid-september onwards , most birds wintering in europe , western turkey and the middle east breeding birds in the british isles and north-west europe are resident or move only short distances migration may be by day or night , and typically involves individuals or small groups in the winter 2017/2018 the first record of a mistle thrush for north america was at miramichi in new brunswick in the south and east of its range , it inhabits upland coniferous woodland and the range extends above the main tree line where dwarf juniper is present in germany and elsewhere in central europe , it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded , first into farmland , and then to suburbs and urban parks their territories are much larger than those of blackbirds or song thrushes ; although the nest territory is only about , around is used for feeding the male will attack intruders into its breeding area , including birds of prey and corvids , and sometimes cats or humans the nest is usually built in a tree in the fork of a branch or against the trunk , although hedges , ledges on buildings and cliff faces may also be used there are normally two broods , except in siberia , where there is only one , the male feeding the fledglings from the first brood while the female sits on the second clutch given its high numbers and very large range , this thrush is therefore classified by the international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern

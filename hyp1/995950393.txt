the mistle thrush was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name turdus is the latin for '' thrush '' , and viscivorus , '' mistletoe eater '' , comes from viscum '' mistletoe '' and vorare , '' to devour '' the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant there are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus turdus , characterised by rounded heads , longish pointed wings , and usually melodious songs they are less closely related to other european thrush species such as the blackbird ( t merula ) which are descended from ancestors that had colonised the caribbean islands from africa and subsequently reached europe from there at least eight subspecies have been proposed , but the differences between them are mainly clinal , with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range turdus viscivorus viscivorus , named by linnaeus , 1758 , the nominate subspecies mistle thrush fossils have been found in pleistocene deposits from poland and sicily the mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to europe the spotting becomes denser on the lower chest , giving the appearance of a breast-band these are similar to the mistle thrush , but the plain–backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars , is more rufous above than its relative , and is barred rather than spotted below the long-tailed thrush has olive-toned upperparts , bars on its breast and two wing bars the male mistle thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles , sounding like chewee-trewuu & nbsp ; trureetruuruu or similar , repeated three to six times , and used to advertise his territory , attract a mate and maintain the pair bond the tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird , but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush 's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower the song is , however , much louder , often audible up to 2 & nbsp ; km ( 2,000 & nbsp ; yd ) away the male is most vocal in the early morning , and its tendency to sing after , and sometimes during , wet and windy weather led to the old name '' stormcock '' viscivorus breeds in europe and in asia east to the ob , beyond which it is replaced by t between mid-october and november , large numbers cross the strait of gibraltar and others pass through cyprus , but there is hardly any migration across the north sea the mistle thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees , including forests , plantations , hedges and town parks in the south and east of its range , it inhabits upland coniferous woodland and the range extends above the main tree line where dwarf juniper is present breeding occurs at up to in the mountains of north africa , and occasionally much higher , to in germany and elsewhere in central europe , it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded , first into farmland , and then to suburbs and urban parks the reasons for this expansion are unclear in areas of intensive farming , such as eastern england , arable land has in turn largely been abandoned in favour of built-up areas with their greater variety of green habitats the discovery attracted many birders from canada and the united states ; sightings continued from early december 2017 through late march 2018 they roost at night in trees or bushes , again typically as individuals or pairs , except in late summer or autumn when families may roost together the mistle thrush is quite terrestrial , hopping with its head held up and body erect ; when excited , it will flick its wings and tail the male will attack intruders into its breeding area , including birds of prey and corvids , and sometimes cats or humans breeding typically commences in mid-march in the south and west of europe ( late february in britain ) , but not till early may in finland the eggs are incubated for 12–15 & nbsp ; days , mainly by the female the mistle thrush is predated upon by a wide variety of birds of prey , including the boreal owl , korpimäki & hakkarainen ( 2012 ) p and syngamus merulae ( a species of gapeworm ) given its high numbers and very large range , this thrush is therefore classified by the international union for conservation of nature as being of least concern the loud call of this common and conspicuous bird also led to many old or local names , including '' screech '' , '' shrite '' and '' gawthrush ''

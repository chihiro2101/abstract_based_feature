the mistle thrush was first described by carl linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of systema naturae under its current scientific name turdus is the latin for '' thrush '' , and viscivorus , '' mistletoe eater '' , comes from viscum '' mistletoe '' and vorare , '' to devour '' the bird 's liking for mistletoe berries is also indicated by its english name , '' mistle '' being an old name for the plant there are more than 60 species of medium to large thrushes in the genus turdus , characterised by rounded heads , longish pointed wings , and usually melodious songs a mitochondrial dna study identified the mistle thrush 's closest relatives as the similarly plumaged song and chinese thrushes ; these three species are early offshoots from the eurasian lineage of turdus thrushes after they spread north from africa they are less closely related to other european thrush species such as the blackbird ( t at least eight subspecies have been proposed , but the differences between them are mainly clinal , with birds being paler and less densely spotted in the east of the range the accepted subspecies as of 2000 are : clement et al mistle thrush fossils have been found in pleistocene deposits from poland and sicily the mistle thrush is the largest thrush native to europe it has pale grey-brown upperparts , the chin and throat are greyish-white , and the yellowish-buff breast and off-white belly are marked with round black spots the long tail has white tips on the outer feathers , and the underwing coverts are white juveniles are similar to adults , but they have paler upperparts with creamy centres to many of the feathers and smaller spots on the yellowish underparts adults have a full moult after breeding , beginning between late may and the end of june , and completed by early october the mistle thrush is much larger , paler and longer-tailed than the sympatric song thrush these are similar to the mistle thrush , but the plainâ€“backed thrush lacks obvious wing bars , is more rufous above than its relative , and is barred rather than spotted below the male mistle thrush has a loud melodious song with fluted whistles , sounding like chewee-trewuu & nbsp ; the tone resembles that of the song thrush or blackbird , but compared to its relatives the mistle thrush 's repertoire is less varied and the delivery is slower the song is , however , much louder , often audible up to 2 & nbsp ; km ( 2,000 & nbsp ; yd ) away the male is most vocal in the early morning , and its tendency to sing after , and sometimes during , wet and windy weather led to the old name '' stormcock '' the song may be heard in any month , although it is uncommon from july to august while the thrush is moulting in the winter 2017/2018 the first record of a mistle thrush for north america was at miramichi in new brunswick the mistle thrush is found in a wide range of habitats containing trees , including forests , plantations , hedges and town parks breeding occurs at up to in the mountains of north africa , and occasionally much higher , to more open habitats , such as agricultural land , moors and grassy hills , are extensively used in winter or on migration in germany and elsewhere in central europe , it was found only in coniferous forest until the mid-1920s when its range rapidly expanded , first into farmland , and then to suburbs and urban parks perhaps the most notable find of the 118th christmas bird count in canada was a single vagrant mistle thrush found in miramichi , new brunswick the discovery attracted many birders from canada and the united states ; sightings continued from early december 2017 through late march 2018 it is not uncommon for up to 50 thrushes to feed together at that time of year the mistle thrush is quite terrestrial , hopping with its head held up and body erect ; when excited , it will flick its wings and tail mistle thrushes breed in the year subsequent to their hatching ; they are monogamous and stay as a pair throughout the year in areas where they are not migratory the common chaffinch often nests close to a mistle thrush , the vigilance of the chaffinch and the aggressive behaviour of the thrush benefiting both species the mistle thrush has been known to kill slowworms and the young of the song thrush , blackbird and dunnock the mistle thrush is not normally a host of the common cuckoo , a brood parasite the early renaissance poem '' the harmony of birds '' features a thrusshe ( mistle thrush ) singing the phrase '' sanctus , sanctus '' , distinguishing the bird from the song thrush , the mauys or throstle '' holm thrush '' , '' hollin cock '' and '' holm cock '' are based on obsolete names for the holly tree , which may be defended by the thrush in winter for its berries

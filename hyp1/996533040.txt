130px a little more than 3,500 years have passed , and in god emperor of dune , leto is now almost fully transformed into a sandworm '' leto 's peace '' has kept the universe quiet for that time , and the entirety of human society has become an audience for him except for leto , the sandworms are extinct , and all that is left of the '' ocean without water '' , bahr bela ma , is a desert preserve set aside for leto alone to ensure that humanity will survive , leto has spent millennia enforcing quiescence on humanity : people rarely travel , rarely fight in wars , rarely do anything but live and worship him this repression has created in humanity a deep and urgent need to explode upon the universe , scattering itself beyond the reach of any single tyrant leto seeks a solution in which he might die without destroying his people ; if a god commits suicide , his worshippers would commit suicide with him the only option is revolution , so leto breeds for the person who will overthrow him : siona atreides , the daughter of his majordomo , moneo thus the tyranny of prescience will end with siona â€” humanity can never again be bound by a powerful prescient like muad'dib or the god emperor himself siona 's partner in revolution is duncan idaho , the constant companion of leto throughout the long millennia malky is a charming lucifer , and as ambassador to leto 's court he plumbs the depths of leto 's piety malky 's purpose is to get leto to turn against his holy creativity , but malky fails because leto , more than anyone , understands the blasphemy of his enterprise the water destroys leto 's sandworm body , decomposing it into the sandtrout that will lock up the water in their bodies , recreating the conditions for the sandworms to re-appear , each with a pearl of leto 's consciousness and adaptability inside it before arrival to tuono , hwi asks leto to '' share their souls '' , since they can not interact physically after leto 's loss of humanity thus leto 's golden path gave humanity both immunity to domination by prescient rulers via siona 's genetic trait , and immunity to domination by any single ruler or disaster by spreading them far and wide into unknown reaches of the universe '' they ( and leto ) are worshipped as the divided god , and their existence keeps humanity locked on leto 's golden path

130px a little more than 3,500 years have passed , and in god emperor of dune , leto is now almost fully transformed into a sandworm he is almost invulnerable to physical damage ; only his face is susceptible to injury , and his single greatest weakness that he shares with the sandworms , an intense vulnerability to water , is a secret '' leto 's peace '' has kept the universe quiet for that time , and the entirety of human society has become an audience for him except for leto , the sandworms are extinct , and all that is left of the '' ocean without water '' , bahr bela ma , is a desert preserve set aside for leto alone leto seeks a solution in which he might die without destroying his people ; if a god commits suicide , his worshippers would commit suicide with him the only option is revolution , so leto breeds for the person who will overthrow him : siona atreides , the daughter of his majordomo , moneo thus the tyranny of prescience will end with siona â€” humanity can never again be bound by a powerful prescient like muad'dib or the god emperor himself malky is a charming lucifer , and as ambassador to leto 's court he plumbs the depths of leto 's piety malky 's purpose is to get leto to turn against his holy creativity , but malky fails because leto , more than anyone , understands the blasphemy of his enterprise at the point of the sareer 's guardian wall that opens to allow for the passage of the idaho river , nayla , caught in her faith in leto , opens fire on the bridge with a lasgun , destroying it as leto and hwi are crossing , dropping them into the idaho river the water destroys leto 's sandworm body , decomposing it into the sandtrout that will lock up the water in their bodies , recreating the conditions for the sandworms to re-appear , each with a pearl of leto 's consciousness and adaptability inside it the sandworms which once again travel dune after leto 's death carry , in his words , '' a pearl of his awareness locked forever in an endless dream '' they ( and leto ) are worshipped as the divided god , and their existence keeps humanity locked on leto 's golden path the current duncan ghola notes that it had been cruel to bring leto back without his twin sister , who had been so much of the original 's life while it is stated that leto had foreseen the conflict with omnius and the thinking machines , the ultimate fate of the golden path , or the worms ' status on synchrony , is left open

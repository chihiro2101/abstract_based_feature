the term klezmer comes from a combination of hebrew words : klei , meaning '' tools , utensils or instruments of '' and zemer , '' melody '' ; leading to k'lei zemer , literally '' instruments of music '' or '' musical instruments '' originally , klezmer referred to musical instruments , and was later extended to refer , as a pejorative , to musicians themselves it was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as '' yiddish '' music , although it is also sometimes called freilech music ( yiddish , literally '' happy music '' ) the first recordings to use the term '' klezmer '' to refer to the music were the klezmorim 's east side wedding and streets of gold in 1977/78 , followed by andy statman and zev feldman 's jewish klezmer music in 1979 a number of dreydlekh ( a yiddish word for ornament ( music ) ) , such as krekhts ( '' sobs '' ) are used to produce this style various musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g the bible has several descriptions of orchestras and levites making music , but after the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce , many rabbis discouraged musical instruments however , the importance of merrymaking at weddings was not diminished , and musicians came forth to fill that niche , klezmorim it is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century bessarabia , where the bulk of today 's traditional repertoire was written klezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue , in particular hazzan music klezmorim often travelled and played with romani musicians ( '' lăutari '' ) , because they occupied similar social strata they had a great influence on each other musically and linguistically ( the extensive klezmer argot in yiddish includes some romani borrowings ) klezmorim were respected for their musical abilities and diverse repertoire , but they were by no means restricted to playing klezmer they sometimes played for christian churches and local aristocracy , and taught some italian classical violin virtuosos some clarinet stylings of swing jazz bandleaders benny goodman and artie shaw can be interpreted as having been derived from klezmer , as can the '' freilach swing '' playing of other jewish artists of the period such as trumpeter ziggy elman at the same time , non-jewish composers were also turning to klezmer for a prolific source of fascinating thematic material in the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the united states and europe , led by giora feidman , the klezmorim , zev feldman , andy statman , and the klezmer conservatory band the 1980s saw a second wave of revival , as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments , largely with non-jews of the united states and germany other artists like yale strom used their first-hand field research and recordings from as early as 1981 in central and eastern europe as a foundation for more of a fusion between traditional repertoire and original compositions , as well as incorporating the rom ( roma ) music element into the jewish style bands like brave old world , hot pstromi and the klezmatics also emerged during this period the new orleans klezmer all-stars also formed in 1991 with a mixture of new orleans funk , jazz , and klezmer styles interest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known avant-garde jazz musicians as john zorn and don byron , who sometimes blend klezmer with jazz mames babegenush was formed in copenhagen , denmark , in 2004 out of strong scandinavian roots merged with traditional klezmer , influenced on the klezmer side by masters like naftule brandwein , abe schwartz and dave tarras today the band has developed a new sound of modern klezmer , pushing the perimeter of klezmer to incorporate many cultures and touring worldwide starting in 2008 , '' the other europeans '' project , funded by several eu cultural institutions , spent a year doing intensive field research in moldavia under the leadership of alan bern and scholar zev feldman they wanted to explore klezmer and lăutari roots , and fuse the music of the two '' other european '' groups as with this ensemble , groups like di naye kapelye and yale strom & hot pstromi have incorporated rom musicians and elements since their inceptions in order to preserve and promote klezmer music in israel , burstein founded the jerusalem klezmer association , which has become a center for learning and performance of klezmer music in the country also , recordings specific to one area may not have represented klezmer repertoire from other parts of the region some ethnomusicological work from jewish eastern europe is still available in print , notably the work of soviet jewish field researcher moshe beregovski in the 21st century , klezmer is typically learned from '' fake books '' and transcriptions of old recordings , although the music was traditionally transmitted and learned by ear in eastern europe , percussion was often provided by a drummer who played a frame drum , or poyk , sometimes called baraban for example , the typical american klezmer wedding band uses a portable electronic synthesizer , not a piano tunes could drag to a near-halt during a particularly sad part , picking up slowly , and eventually bursting into happy song again barcelona gipsy klezmer

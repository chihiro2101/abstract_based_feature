the term klezmer comes from a combination of hebrew words : klei , meaning '' tools , utensils or instruments of '' and zemer , '' melody '' ; leading to k'lei zemer , literally '' instruments of music '' or '' musical instruments '' originally , klezmer referred to musical instruments , and was later extended to refer , as a pejorative , to musicians themselves it was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as '' yiddish '' music , although it is also sometimes called freilech music ( yiddish , literally '' happy music '' ) the first recordings to use the term '' klezmer '' to refer to the music were the klezmorim 's east side wedding and streets of gold in 1977/78 , followed by andy statman and zev feldman 's jewish klezmer music in 1979 various musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g the bible has several descriptions of orchestras and levites making music , but after the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce , many rabbis discouraged musical instruments it is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century bessarabia , where the bulk of today 's traditional repertoire was written klezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue , in particular hazzan music they had a great influence on each other musically and linguistically ( the extensive klezmer argot in yiddish includes some romani borrowings ) klezmorim were respected for their musical abilities and diverse repertoire , but they were by no means restricted to playing klezmer the first musician to play klezmer in european concerts , josef gusikov , played a type of xylophone which he invented and called a '' wood and straw instrument '' also , a shift towards brass and percussion happened when klezmorim were conscripted into military bands as jews left eastern europe and the shtetls ( see a related article about the artist chaim goldberg , who depicted klezmer performers of the shtetl in his paintings ) , klezmer spread throughout the globe , to the united states as well as to canada , mexico , and argentina jews began to adopt mainstream culture , the popularity of klezmer waned , and jewish celebrations were increasingly accompanied by non-jewish music george gershwin was familiar with klezmer music , and the opening clarinet glissando of rhapsody in blue suggests this influence , although the composer did not compose klezmer directly in the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the united states and europe , led by giora feidman , the klezmorim , zev feldman , andy statman , and the klezmer conservatory band the 1980s saw a second wave of revival , as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments , largely with non-jews of the united states and germany musicians began to track down older european klezmer , by listening to recordings , finding transcriptions , and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in eastern europe other artists like yale strom used their first-hand field research and recordings from as early as 1981 in central and eastern europe as a foundation for more of a fusion between traditional repertoire and original compositions , as well as incorporating the rom ( roma ) music element into the jewish style bands like brave old world , hot pstromi and the klezmatics also emerged during this period in the 1990s , musicians from the san francisco bay area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory interest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known avant-garde jazz musicians as john zorn and don byron , who sometimes blend klezmer with jazz the band 's most recent album mames babegenush with strings ( 2017 ) was warmly received with 5-6 stars reviews in such magazines as songlines and froots starting in 2008 , '' the other europeans '' project , funded by several eu cultural institutions , spent a year doing intensive field research in moldavia under the leadership of alan bern and scholar zev feldman they wanted to explore klezmer and lăutari roots , and fuse the music of the two '' other european '' groups as with this ensemble , groups like di naye kapelye and yale strom & hot pstromi have incorporated rom musicians and elements since their inceptions according to walter zev feldman , the klezmer dance repertoire seems to have been relatively uniform across the areas of jewish settlement in the russian empire few scions of klezmer dynasties remained in europe , one notable exception being leopold kozlowski of poland also , recordings specific to one area may not have represented klezmer repertoire from other parts of the region a few older klezmorim—such as leon schwartz , dave tarras , and german goldenshtayn—survived into the klezmer revival era and could recall some forgotten repertoire 31 ( 387 ) of the 5th of april , 2002 percussion in early 20th-century klezmer recordings was generally minimal—no more than a wood block or snare drum the compositions of israeli-born composer ofer ben-amots incorporate aspects of klezmer music , most notably his 2006 composition klezmer concerto mi shebeirach means '' he who blessed '' in hebrew , from the mi shebeirach prayer , recited after the honor of being called to the torah reading it is similar to the western mixolydian mode and can be thought of as a major scale with a lowered 7th , which is sometimes raised at cadences , but is generally avoided altogether yivo encyclopedia article on traditional and instrumental music of eastern

the term klezmer comes from a combination of hebrew words : klei , meaning '' tools , utensils or instruments of '' and zemer , '' melody '' ; leading to k'lei zemer , literally '' instruments of music '' or '' musical instruments '' originally , klezmer referred to musical instruments , and was later extended to refer , as a pejorative , to musicians themselves it was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as '' yiddish '' music , although it is also sometimes called freilech music ( yiddish , literally '' happy music '' ) the first recordings to use the term '' klezmer '' to refer to the music were the klezmorim 's east side wedding and streets of gold in 1977/78 , followed by andy statman and zev feldman 's jewish klezmer music in 1979 klezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies , reminiscent of the human voice , complete with laughing and weeping a number of dreydlekh ( a yiddish word for ornament ( music ) ) , such as krekhts ( '' sobs '' ) are used to produce this style various musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g it is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century bessarabia , where the bulk of today 's traditional repertoire was written klezmorim often travelled and played with romani musicians ( '' lăutari '' ) , because they occupied similar social strata klezmorim were respected for their musical abilities and diverse repertoire , but they were by no means restricted to playing klezmer hence musicians took up the violin , tsimbl ( or cymbalom ) , and other stringed instruments the first musician to play klezmer in european concerts , josef gusikov , played a type of xylophone which he invented and called a '' wood and straw instrument '' it was laid out like a cymbalom , and attracted comments from felix mendelssohn ( highly favourable ) and liszt ( condemnatory ) also , a shift towards brass and percussion happened when klezmorim were conscripted into military bands as jews left eastern europe and the shtetls ( see a related article about the artist chaim goldberg , who depicted klezmer performers of the shtetl in his paintings ) , klezmer spread throughout the globe , to the united states as well as to canada , mexico , and argentina while traditional performances may have been on the decline , many jewish composers who had mainstream success , such as leonard bernstein and aaron copland , continued to be influenced by the klezmeric idioms heard during their youth ( as gustav mahler had been ) in the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the united states and europe , led by giora feidman , the klezmorim , zev feldman , andy statman , and the klezmer conservatory band the 1980s saw a second wave of revival , as interest grew in more traditionally inspired performances with string instruments , largely with non-jews of the united states and germany musicians began to track down older european klezmer , by listening to recordings , finding transcriptions , and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in eastern europe interest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known avant-garde jazz musicians as john zorn and don byron , who sometimes blend klezmer with jazz klezmer melodies have recently been incorporated into songs by third-wave ska band streetlight manifesto mames babegenush was formed in copenhagen , denmark , in 2004 out of strong scandinavian roots merged with traditional klezmer , influenced on the klezmer side by masters like naftule brandwein , abe schwartz and dave tarras today the band has developed a new sound of modern klezmer , pushing the perimeter of klezmer to incorporate many cultures and touring worldwide they wanted to explore klezmer and lăutari roots , and fuse the music of the two '' other european '' groups as with this ensemble , groups like di naye kapelye and yale strom & hot pstromi have incorporated rom musicians and elements since their inceptions a separate klezmer tradition had developed in israel in the 20th century clarinetists moshe berlin and avrum leib burstein are known exponents of the klezmer style in israel in order to preserve and promote klezmer music in israel , burstein founded the jerusalem klezmer association , which has become a center for learning and performance of klezmer music in the country according to walter zev feldman , the klezmer dance repertoire seems to have been relatively uniform across the areas of jewish settlement in the russian empire historically , young klezmorim learned tunes from their family and their elders in bands also , recordings specific to one area may not have represented klezmer repertoire from other parts of the region some ethnomusicological work from jewish eastern europe is still available in print , notably the work of soviet jewish field researcher moshe beregovski the inclusion of jews in tsarist army bands during the 19th century led to the introduction of typical military band instruments into klezmer some klezmer revival bands look to loud-instrument klezmer , jazz , and dixieland for inspiration in its historic form , klezmer was live music designed to facilitate dancing yivo encyclopedia article on traditional and instrumental music of eastern european jews recordings of yiddish songs on the library of congress website klezmerguide.com

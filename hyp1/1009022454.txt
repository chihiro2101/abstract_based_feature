the term klezmer comes from a combination of hebrew words : klei , meaning '' tools , utensils or instruments of '' and zemer , '' melody '' ; leading to k'lei zemer , literally '' instruments of music '' or '' musical instruments '' early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as '' yiddish '' music , although it is also sometimes called freilech music ( yiddish , literally '' happy music '' ) the first recordings to use the term '' klezmer '' to refer to the music were the klezmorim 's east side wedding and streets of gold in 1977/78 , followed by andy statman and zev feldman 's jewish klezmer music in 1979 klezmer is easily identifiable by its characteristic expressive melodies , reminiscent of the human voice , complete with laughing and weeping a number of dreydlekh ( a yiddish word for ornament ( music ) ) , such as krekhts ( '' sobs '' ) are used to produce this style various musical styles influenced traditional klezmer music perhaps the strongest and most enduring is romanian music klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g the bible has several descriptions of orchestras and levites making music , but after the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce , many rabbis discouraged musical instruments however , the importance of merrymaking at weddings was not diminished , and musicians came forth to fill that niche , klezmorim the first klezmer known by name was yakobius ben yakobius , a player of the aulos in samaria in the 2nd century ce it is unlikely that they played music recognizable as klezmer today since the style and structure of klezmer as we know it today is thought to have come largely from 19th century bessarabia , where the bulk of today 's traditional repertoire was written klezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue , in particular hazzan music klezmorim often travelled and played with romani musicians ( '' lăutari '' ) , because they occupied similar social strata klezmorim were respected for their musical abilities and diverse repertoire , but they were by no means restricted to playing klezmer they sometimes played for christian churches and local aristocracy , and taught some italian classical violin virtuosos in ukraine they were banned from playing loud instruments , until the 19th century the first musician to play klezmer in european concerts , josef gusikov , played a type of xylophone which he invented and called a '' wood and straw instrument '' as jews left eastern europe and the shtetls ( see a related article about the artist chaim goldberg , who depicted klezmer performers of the shtetl in his paintings ) , klezmer spread throughout the globe , to the united states as well as to canada , mexico , and argentina in the 1920s , clarinetists dave tarras and naftule brandwein caused a brief , influential revival , but hankus netsky has noted that '' few of the performers of this era actually referred to themselves as klezmorim , and the term is found nowhere in any jewish instrumental recording of the time jews began to adopt mainstream culture , the popularity of klezmer waned , and jewish celebrations were increasingly accompanied by non-jewish music george gershwin was familiar with klezmer music , and the opening clarinet glissando of rhapsody in blue suggests this influence , although the composer did not compose klezmer directly in the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the united states and europe , led by giora feidman , the klezmorim , zev feldman , andy statman , and the klezmer conservatory band musicians began to track down older european klezmer , by listening to recordings , finding transcriptions , and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in eastern europe bands like brave old world , hot pstromi and the klezmatics also emerged during this period in the 1990s , musicians from the san francisco bay area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory the new orleans klezmer all-stars also formed in 1991 with a mixture of new orleans funk , jazz , and klezmer styles singer/songwriter tomas kalnoky frequently slips in horn licks with russian and jewish origins mames babegenush was formed in copenhagen , denmark , in 2004 out of strong scandinavian roots merged with traditional klezmer , influenced on the klezmer side by masters like naftule brandwein , abe schwartz and dave tarras today the band has developed a new sound of modern klezmer , pushing the perimeter of klezmer to incorporate many cultures and touring worldwide according to walter zev feldman , the klezmer dance repertoire seems to have been relatively uniform across the areas of jewish settlement in the russian empire in the 21st century , klezmer is typically learned from '' fake books '' and transcriptions of old recordings , although the music was traditionally transmitted and learned by ear the name '' bulgar '' ( yiddish '' bulgarish '' ) comes from the romanian traditional song and dance ( romanian bulgarească ) the inclusion of jews in tsarist army bands during the 19th century led to the introduction of typical military band instruments into klezmer the piece is for klezmer clarinet ( written for jewish clarinetist david krakauer ) , string orchestra , harp and percussion ) like other musicians of their time , and many modern jazz performers , early klezmorim did not rigidly follow the beat much of klezmer music uses the ahavah rabboh scale ( such as nigun rikud , tish nigun and numerous freylekhs ) , although mi sheberach is prevalent as well barcelona gipsy klezmer orchestra (

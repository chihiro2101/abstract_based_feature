the term klezmer comes from a combination of hebrew words : klei , meaning '' tools , utensils or instruments of '' and zemer , '' melody '' ; leading to k'lei zemer , literally '' instruments of music '' or '' musical instruments '' originally , klezmer referred to musical instruments , and was later extended to refer , as a pejorative , to musicians themselves it was not until the late 20th century that the word came to identify a musical genre early 20th century recordings and writings most often refer to the style as '' yiddish '' music , although it is also sometimes called freilech music ( yiddish , literally '' happy music '' ) the first recordings to use the term '' klezmer '' to refer to the music were the klezmorim 's east side wedding and streets of gold in 1977/78 , followed by andy statman and zev feldman 's jewish klezmer music in 1979 a number of dreydlekh ( a yiddish word for ornament ( music ) ) , such as krekhts ( '' sobs '' ) are used to produce this style klezmer musicians heard and adapted traditional romanian music , which is reflected in the dance forms found throughout surviving klezmer music repertoire ( e.g the bible has several descriptions of orchestras and levites making music , but after the destruction of the second temple in 70 ce , many rabbis discouraged musical instruments however , the importance of merrymaking at weddings was not diminished , and musicians came forth to fill that niche , klezmorim the first klezmer known by name was yakobius ben yakobius , a player of the aulos in samaria in the 2nd century ce klezmorim based much of their secular instrumental music upon the devotional vocal music of the synagogue , in particular hazzan music klezmorim often travelled and played with romani musicians ( '' lăutari '' ) , because they occupied similar social strata they had a great influence on each other musically and linguistically ( the extensive klezmer argot in yiddish includes some romani borrowings ) jews began to adopt mainstream culture , the popularity of klezmer waned , and jewish celebrations were increasingly accompanied by non-jewish music while traditional performances may have been on the decline , many jewish composers who had mainstream success , such as leonard bernstein and aaron copland , continued to be influenced by the klezmeric idioms heard during their youth ( as gustav mahler had been ) some clarinet stylings of swing jazz bandleaders benny goodman and artie shaw can be interpreted as having been derived from klezmer , as can the '' freilach swing '' playing of other jewish artists of the period such as trumpeter ziggy elman at the same time , non-jewish composers were also turning to klezmer for a prolific source of fascinating thematic material in the mid-to-late 1970s there was a klezmer revival in the united states and europe , led by giora feidman , the klezmorim , zev feldman , andy statman , and the klezmer conservatory band in 1985 , henry sapoznik and adrienne cooper founded klezkamp to teach klezmer and other yiddish music musicians began to track down older european klezmer , by listening to recordings , finding transcriptions , and making field recordings of the few klezmorim left in eastern europe other artists like yale strom used their first-hand field research and recordings from as early as 1981 in central and eastern europe as a foundation for more of a fusion between traditional repertoire and original compositions , as well as incorporating the rom ( roma ) music element into the jewish style in the 1990s , musicians from the san francisco bay area helped further interest in klezmer music by taking it into new territory interest in klezmer has been sustained and supported by such well-known avant-garde jazz musicians as john zorn and don byron , who sometimes blend klezmer with jazz mames babegenush was formed in copenhagen , denmark , in 2004 out of strong scandinavian roots merged with traditional klezmer , influenced on the klezmer side by masters like naftule brandwein , abe schwartz and dave tarras today the band has developed a new sound of modern klezmer , pushing the perimeter of klezmer to incorporate many cultures and touring worldwide starting in 2008 , '' the other europeans '' project , funded by several eu cultural institutions , spent a year doing intensive field research in moldavia under the leadership of alan bern and scholar zev feldman as with this ensemble , groups like di naye kapelye and yale strom & hot pstromi have incorporated rom musicians and elements since their inceptions a separate klezmer tradition had developed in israel in the 20th century clarinetists moshe berlin and avrum leib burstein are known exponents of the klezmer style in israel in order to preserve and promote klezmer music in israel , burstein founded the jerusalem klezmer association , which has become a center for learning and performance of klezmer music in the country however , there were several times in history where this transmission broke down , including mass emigration , but especially the holocaust , which destroyed most of jewish life and culture in europe also , recordings specific to one area may not have represented klezmer repertoire from other parts of the region some ethnomusicological work from jewish eastern europe is still available in print , notably the work of soviet jewish field researcher moshe beregovski in the 21st century , klezmer is typically learned from '' fake books '' and transcriptions of old recordings , although the music was traditionally transmitted and learned by ear sirba & nbsp ; – a romanian dance in or ( romanian sârbă ) some klezmer revival bands look to loud-instrument klezmer , jazz , and dixieland for

thus spoke zarathustra , the ideas of which first came to nietzsche while walking on two roads surrounding rapallo , was conceived while writing the gay science according to elisabeth förster-nietzsche in the introduction of thomas common 's early translation of the book , nietzsche wrote that the ideas for zarathustra first came to him while walking on two roads surrounding rapallo as evidence of this , he made a small note that read '' 6,000 feet beyond man and time nietzsche planned to write the book in three parts over several years nietzsche commented in ecce homo that for the completion of each part , '' ten days sufficed ; in no case , neither for the first nor for the third and last , did i require more the first three parts were first published separately , and were subsequently published in a single volume in 1887 the fourth part remained private after nietzsche wrote it in 1885 ; a scant forty copies were all that were printed , apart from seven others that were distributed to nietzsche 's close friends in march 1892 , the four parts were finally reprinted as a single volume for instance , words beginning with über ( 'over , above ' ) and ( 'down , below ' ) are often paired to emphasise the contrast , which is not always possible to bring out in translation , except by coinages nietzsche pairs this word with its opposite übergang ( 'over-going ' ) , used to mean 'transition ' it possesses a unique experimental style , one that is , for instance , evident in newly invented '' dithyrambs '' narrated or sung by zarathustra likewise , the separate dionysian-dithyrambs was written in autumn 1888 , and printed with the full volume in 1892 , as the corollaries of zarathustra 's '' abundance '' some speculate that nietzsche intended to write about final acts of creation and destruction brought on by zarathustra zarathustra also contains the famous dictum '' god is dead , '' which had appeared earlier in the gay science he continued to emphasize his philosophical concerns ; generally , his intention was to show an alternative to repressive moral codes and to avert '' nihilism '' in all of its varied forms other aspects of thus spoke zarathustra relate to nietzsche 's proposed '' transvaluation of values '' while nietzsche injects myriad ideas into the book , a few recurring themes stand out the overman ( übermensch ) , a self-mastered individual who has achieved his full power , is a nearly omnipresent concept in the book , whereby humankind is merely a bridge between animals and the overman the symbol of the übermensch alludes to nietzsche 's notions of '' self-mastery , '' '' self-cultivation , '' '' self-direction , '' and '' self-overcoming opting to change any decision or event in one 's life would indicate the presence of resentment or fear ; contradistinctly the overman is characterized by courage and a dionysian spirit the mention of this notion in the gay science ( e.g , § 341 ) was the first public proclamation of the notion by him apart from its salient presence in zarathustra , it is also echoed throughout nietzsche 's work it is by zarathustra 's transfiguration that he embraces eternity , that he at last ascertains '' the supreme will to power many criticisms of christianity can be found in thus spoke zarathustra , particularly christian values of good and evil and its belief in an afterlife it also features frequent references to the western literary and philosophy traditions , implicitly offering an interpretation of these traditions and of their problems this characteristic ( following the genre of the bildungsroman ) can be seen as an inline commentary on zarathustra 's ( and nietzsche 's ) philosophy the style of the book , along with its ambiguity and paradox nature , has helped its eventual enthusiastic reception by the reading public , but has frustrated academic attempts at analysis ( as nietzsche may have intended ) this irony relates to an internal conflict of nietzsche 's : he hated religious leaders but perceived himself as at least somewhat akin to one common reasoned that because the original german was written in a pseudo-luther bible , a pseudo-king-james-biblical style would be fitting in the english translation '' in thus spoke zarathustra nietzsche 's 'thus spoke zarathustra ' : before sunrise ( essay collection ) , edited by james luchte nietzsche 's epic of the soul : thus spoke zarathustra the work ends with a setting of '' zarathustra 's roundelay '' which delius had composed earlier , in 1898 , as a separate work

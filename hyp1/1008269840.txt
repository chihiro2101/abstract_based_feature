the suffix -man had the meaning '' person '' in old english ( see man ) , but in present-day english it is predominantly masculine thus job titles that include this suffix , such as fireman , salesman and alderman , generally imply that the holder is male while some of these job titles have feminine variants ( e.g alderwoman ) , others do not , because traditionally the positions in question were not occupied by women the case for switching to gender-neutral job titles usually makes an ideology argument , that gender-specific job titles at some level promote sexism in the workplace the third person singular pronoun he , although the use of singular they is increasingly common ) , there are gender-neutral versions of nearly all job titles this produced words like doctress and professoress and even lawyeress , all of which have fallen out of use ; though waitress , stewardess , and actress are in modern use '' some usage guides , such as the cambridge guide to english usage , advocate gender-neutral language in circumstances where all sexes are meant to be included proponents of gender-neutral job titles believe that such titles should be used , especially when referring to hypothetical persons once that position is filled , many advocates believe gender can be attached to the title as appropriate ( chairman or chairwoman ) the principle of gender-neutral language dictates that job titles that add suffixes to make them feminine should be avoided advisors on non-sexist usage deprecate terms such as '' male nurse '' , '' female doctor '' , '' male model '' , or '' female judge '' because such terms are often used when the gender is irrelevant

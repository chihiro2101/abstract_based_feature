is achieved a bundle of the supporting material ( typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers ) is soaked in water or a thin water/glue mixture for a short time the sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks for direct-burning incense , the tip or end of the incense is ignited with a flame or other heat source

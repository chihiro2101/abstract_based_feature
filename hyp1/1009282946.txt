burning incense mixture not only binds the fragrant material together but also allows the produced incense to burn with a self-sustained ember , which propagates slowly and evenly through an entire piece of incense with such regularity that it can be used to mark time fragrant materials are added to the base prior to shaping , as in the case of powdered incense materials , or after , as in the case of essential oils natural plant-based binders : gums such as gum arabic or tragacanth are used to bind the mixture together the mucilage from the wet binding powder holds the fragrant material together while the cellulose in the powder combusts to form a stable ember when lit incense is available in various forms and degrees of processing they can generally be separated into '' direct-burning '' and '' indirect-burning '' types indirect-burning incense , also called '' non-combustible incense '' , is an aromatic material or combination of materials , such as resins , that

china or south east asia small quantities of water are combined with the fragrance and incense base mixture and kneaded into a hard dough in a process known as '' splitting the foot of the incense stick '' , the bamboo is trimmed to length , soaked , peeled , and split in halves until the thin sticks of bamboo have square cross sections of less than 3mm a bundle of the supporting material ( typically thin bamboo or sandalwood slivers ) is soaked in water or a thin water/glue mixture for a short time three to four layers of powder are coated onto the sticks , forming a 2 mm thick layer of incense material on the stick incense sticks produced in this fashion and burned in temples of chinese folk religion can have a thickness between 2 and 4 millimeters the egōro is usually made of brass , with a long handle and no chain for direct-burning incense , the tip or end of the incense is ignited with a flame or other heat source until the incense begins to turn into ash at the burning end

arabic or tragacanth are used to bind the mixture together indirect-burning incense , also called '' non-combustible incense '' , is an aromatic material or combination of materials , such as resins , that does not contain combustible material and so requires a separate heat source whole : the incense material is burned directly in raw form on top of coal embers paste : powdered or granulated incense material is mixed with a sticky incombustible binder , such as dried fruit , honey , or a soft resin and then formed to balls or small pastilles direct-burning incense , also called '' combustible incense '' , is lit directly by a flame direct-burning incense is either extruded , pressed into forms , or coated onto a supporting material this class of incense is made from a moldable substrate of fragrant finely ground ( or liquid ) incense materials and odourless binder the composition must be adjusted to provide fragrance in the proper concentration and to ensure even burning

powder-coating is used mainly to produce cored incense of either larger coil ( up to 1 meter in diameter ) or cored stick forms the sticks are then gently rolled and packed to maintain roundness while more incense powder is repeatedly tossed onto the sticks the coated incense is then allowed to dry in open air additional coatings of incense mixture can be applied after each period of successive drying incense sticks produced in this fashion and burned in temples of chinese folk religion can have a thickness between 2 and 4 millimeters compression : a damp powder is mechanically formed around

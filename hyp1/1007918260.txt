the play begins with praxagora emerging from a house on an athenian street before daybreak the chorus of athenian women enter one by one , all dressed in similar costume the women are wary of the plan and praxagora attempts to rally them as they practice speaking as men before the assembly praxagora is frustrated by the women 's inability to pretend to be men , as they swear to demeter and persephone rather than apollo , address the assembled women as ladies , and complain about the discomfort of their disguises and their thirst she proposes that the men turn control of the government over to the women because '' after all , we employ them as stewards and treasurers in our own households '' she further explains that women are superior to men because they are harder workers , devoted to tradition and do not bother with useless innovations praxagora impresses the women with her rhetorical skills , and explains that it was learned from listening to orators while living with her husband on the pnyx , where the athenian assembly was held the chorus of women reiterate their intentions before exiting the stage chremes , returning from the assembly , comes upon blepyrus and his neighbor and explains that he was not paid because of the unprecedented turn-out of pale faced shoe-makers ( referring to the women in disguise ) she proposes banning all ownership of private wealth and establishing equal pay for all and a unified standard of living she further explains that people will no longer have a need for personal wealth as all basic needs will be met by the common fund she further adds that men and women will be free to sleep with anyone they want , so long as they first sleep with the uglier members of the opposite sex the ascent of women in political power in assemblywomen is yet another commentary on what aristophanes saw as the shameful effeminacy of the men currently in power in athens the fact that women in this instance could enter the assembly and successfully pass as men was a commentary on politicians being indistinguishable from women in costume

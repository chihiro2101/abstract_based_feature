the play begins with praxagora emerging from a house on an athenian street before daybreak the chorus of athenian women enter one by one , all dressed in similar costume one woman brings a basket full of yarn in order to get some work done as the assembly fills up , to which praxagora chastises her for this decision as it will ruin their cover the women are wary of the plan and praxagora attempts to rally them as they practice speaking as men before the assembly praxagora is frustrated by the women 's inability to pretend to be men , as they swear to demeter and persephone rather than apollo , address the assembled women as ladies , and complain about the discomfort of their disguises and their thirst praxagora decides that she alone is capable of speaking to the assembly and practices a speech decrying the corrupt leaders of the city as selfish and unpatriotic through their acts of war and personal enrichment through public funds she proposes that the men turn control of the government over to the women because '' after all , we employ them as stewards and treasurers in our own households praxagora impresses the women with her rhetorical skills , and explains that it was learned from listening to orators while living with her husband on the pnyx , where the athenian assembly was held as he squats in the street lamenting his constipation , his neighbor arrives and both men realize that their wives and clothing are missing from their homes chremes , returning from the assembly , comes upon blepyrus and his neighbor and explains that he was not paid because of the unprecedented turn-out of pale faced shoe-makers ( referring to the women in disguise ) she further explains that people will no longer have a need for personal wealth as all basic needs will be met by the common fund the comic tradition of women in politics was in fact common , as seen through aristophanes ' plays lysistrata and thesmophoriazusae the ascent of women in political power in assemblywomen is yet another commentary on what aristophanes saw as the shameful effeminacy of the men currently in power in athens assemblywomen does not fall neatly within the confines of old or new comedy and is generally considered middle comedy

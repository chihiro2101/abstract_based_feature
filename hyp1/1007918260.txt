the chorus of athenian women enter one by one , all dressed in similar costume one woman brings a basket full of yarn in order to get some work done as the assembly fills up , to which praxagora chastises her for this decision as it will ruin their cover the women are wary of the plan and praxagora attempts to rally them as they practice speaking as men before the assembly praxagora is frustrated by the women 's inability to pretend to be men , as they swear to demeter and persephone rather than apollo , address the assembled women as ladies , and complain about the discomfort of their disguises and their thirst praxagora decides that she alone is capable of speaking to the assembly and practices a speech decrying the corrupt leaders of the city as selfish and unpatriotic through their acts of war and personal enrichment through public funds praxagora impresses the women with her rhetorical skills , and explains that it was learned from listening to orators while living with her husband on the pnyx , where the athenian assembly was held praxagora 's husband blepyrus emerges from their house wearing praxagora 's nightgown and slippers chremes , returning from the assembly , comes upon blepyrus and his neighbor and explains that he was not paid because of the unprecedented turn-out of pale faced shoe-makers ( referring to the women in disguise ) now free of attending the assembly , the men are pleased to finally sleep in , but are not excited about having to provide sex to receive their breakfast the chorus enters , still in disguise and on their way home from the assembly , trying not to draw attention to themselves she further adds that men and women will be free to sleep with anyone they want , so long as they first sleep with the uglier members of the opposite sex after the neighbor leaves to donate his possessions , the selfish man explains that he intends to keep his belongings and enjoy the free dinner at the same time the ascent of women in political power in assemblywomen is yet another commentary on what aristophanes saw as the shameful effeminacy of the men currently in power in athens the fact that women in this instance could enter the assembly and successfully pass as men was a commentary on politicians being indistinguishable from women in costume

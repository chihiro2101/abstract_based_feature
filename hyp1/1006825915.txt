the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware the latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task , such as image processing or pattern matching , as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware this resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware in the 1980s and 1990s there was a renaissance in this area of research with many proposed reconfigurable architectures developed in industry and academia , c bobda : introduction to reconfigurable computing : architectures ; springer , 2007 such as : copacobana , matrix , garp , hauser , john r and wawrzynek , john , '' garp : a mips processor with a reconfigurable coprocessor '' , proceedings of the ieee symposium on field-programmable custom computing machines ( fccm '97 , april 16â€“18 , 1997 ) , pp some of these massively parallel reconfigurable computers were built primarily for special subdomains such as molecular evolution , neural or image processing computer scientist reiner hartenstein describes reconfigurable computing in terms of an anti-machine that , according to him , represents a fundamental paradigm shift away from the more conventional von neumann machine high-performance reconfigurable computing ( hprc ) is a computer architecture combining reconfigurable computing-based accelerators like field-programmable gate array with cpus or multi-core processors the increase of logic in an fpga has enabled larger and more complex algorithms to be programmed into the fpga one research area is the twin-paradigm programming tool flow productivity obtained for such heterogeneous systems the us national science foundation has a center for high-performance reconfigurable computing ( chrec ) commercial high-performance reconfigurable computing systems are beginning to emerge with the announcement of ibm integrating fpgas with its power processor partial re-configuration is the process of changing a portion of reconfigurable hardware circuitry while the other portion keeps its former configuration partial reconfiguration allows for critical parts of the design to continue operating while a controller either on the fpga or off of it loads a partial design into a reconfigurable module partial reconfiguration is not supported on all fpgas while the partial data is sent into the fpga , the rest of the device is stopped ( in the shutdown mode ) and brought up after the configuration is completed high granularity , which can also be known as fine-grained , often implies a greater flexibility when implementing algorithms into the hardware some of the most intuitive designs use a peripheral bus to provide a coprocessor like arrangement for the reconfigurable array one of the key challenges for reconfigurable computing is to enable higher design productivity and provide an easier way to use reconfigurable computing systems for users that are unfamiliar with the underlying concepts computing with memory glossary of reconfigurable computing iland project m-labs 1chipmsx piperench psoc sprinter

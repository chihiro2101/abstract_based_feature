the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware the latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task , such as image processing or pattern matching , as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware this resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware in the 1980s and 1990s there was a renaissance in this area of research with many proposed reconfigurable architectures developed in industry and academia , c bobda : introduction to reconfigurable computing : architectures ; springer , 2007 such as : copacobana , matrix , garp , hauser , john r , '' a vliw processor with reconfigurable instruction set for embedded applications '' , solid-state circuits conference , 2003 some of these massively parallel reconfigurable computers were built primarily for special subdomains such as molecular evolution , neural or image processing high-performance reconfigurable computing ( hprc ) is a computer architecture combining reconfigurable computing-based accelerators like field-programmable gate array with cpus or multi-core processors the attachment of such an fpga to a modern cpu over a high speed bus , like pci express , has enabled the configurable logic to act more like a coprocessor rather than a peripheral some supercomputer firms offer heterogeneous processing blocks including fpgas as accelerators one research area is the twin-paradigm programming tool flow productivity obtained for such heterogeneous systems partial re-configuration is the process of changing a portion of reconfigurable hardware circuitry while the other portion keeps its former configuration electronic hardware , like software , can be designed modularly , by creating subcomponents and then higher-level components to instantiate them partial reconfiguration allows for critical parts of the design to continue operating while a controller either on the fpga or off of it loads a partial design into a reconfigurable module partial reconfiguration also can be used to save space for multiple designs by only storing the partial designs that change between designs partial reconfiguration is not supported on all fpgas a special software flow with emphasis on modular design is required typically the design modules are built along well defined boundaries inside the fpga that require the design to be specially mapped to the internal hardware such projects are built with reconfigurable hardware ( fpgas ) , and some devices support emulation of multiple vintage computers using a single reconfigurable hardware ( c-one ) the quartus prime pro software also support hierarchical partial reconfiguration and simulation of partial reconfiguration one of the key challenges for reconfigurable computing is to enable higher design productivity and provide an easier way to use reconfigurable computing systems for users that are unfamiliar with the underlying concepts

the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware the latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task , such as image processing or pattern matching , as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware in the 1980s and 1990s there was a renaissance in this area of research with many proposed reconfigurable architectures developed in industry and academia , c bobda : introduction to reconfigurable computing : architectures ; springer , 2007 such as : copacobana , matrix , garp , hauser , john r and wawrzynek , john , '' garp : a mips processor with a reconfigurable coprocessor '' , proceedings of the ieee symposium on field-programmable custom computing machines ( fccm '97 , april 16â€“18 , 1997 ) , pp 1 , 2003 such designs were feasible due to the constant progress of silicon technology that let complex designs be implemented on one chip it was not a commercial success , but was promising enough that xilinx ( the inventor of the fpga , fpga ) bought the technology and hired the algotronix staff high-performance reconfigurable computing ( hprc ) is a computer architecture combining reconfigurable computing-based accelerators like field-programmable gate array with cpus or multi-core processors the increase of logic in an fpga has enabled larger and more complex algorithms to be programmed into the fpga the attachment of such an fpga to a modern cpu over a high speed bus , like pci express , has enabled the configurable logic to act more like a coprocessor rather than a peripheral furthermore , by replicating an algorithm on an fpga or the use of a multiplicity of fpgas has enabled reconfigurable simd systems to be produced where several computational devices can concurrently operate on different data , which is highly parallel computing this heterogeneous systems technique is used in computing research and especially in supercomputing partial re-configuration is the process of changing a portion of reconfigurable hardware circuitry while the other portion keeps its former configuration partial reconfiguration allows for critical parts of the design to continue operating while a controller either on the fpga or off of it loads a partial design into a reconfigurable module with the advent of affordable fpga boards , students ' and hobbyists ' projects seek to recreate vintage computers or implement more novel architectures such projects are built with reconfigurable hardware ( fpgas ) , and some devices support emulation of multiple vintage computers using a single reconfigurable hardware ( c-one ) module-based partial reconfiguration permits to reconfigure distinct modular parts of the design , while difference-based partial reconfiguration can be used when a small change is made to a design intel supports partial reconfiguration of their fpga devices on 28 & nbsp ; nm devices such as stratix v , and on the 20 & nbsp ; nm arria 10 devices in a typical reconfigurable system , a bit stream is used to program the device at deployment time intuitively , the slower the rate of reconfiguration the smaller the energy consumption as the associated energy cost of reconfiguration are amortised over a longer period of time one of the key challenges for reconfigurable computing is to enable higher design productivity and provide an easier way to use reconfigurable computing systems for users that are unfamiliar with the underlying concepts

the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware the latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task , such as image processing or pattern matching , as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware this resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware in the 1980s and 1990s there was a renaissance in this area of research with many proposed reconfigurable architectures developed in industry and academia , c , '' a vliw processor with reconfigurable instruction set for embedded applications '' , solid-state circuits conference , 2003 a decade of reconfigurable computing : a visionary retrospective high-performance reconfigurable computing ( hprc ) is a computer architecture combining reconfigurable computing-based accelerators like field-programmable gate array with cpus or multi-core processors the attachment of such an fpga to a modern cpu over a high speed bus , like pci express , has enabled the configurable logic to act more like a coprocessor rather than a peripheral this has brought reconfigurable computing into the high-performance computing sphere one research area is the twin-paradigm programming tool flow productivity obtained for such heterogeneous systems the us national science foundation has a center for high-performance reconfigurable computing ( chrec ) commercial high-performance reconfigurable computing systems are beginning to emerge with the announcement of ibm integrating fpgas with its power processor partial reconfiguration allows for critical parts of the design to continue operating while a controller either on the fpga or off of it loads a partial design into a reconfigurable module partial reconfiguration is not supported on all fpgas while the partial data is sent into the fpga , the rest of the device is stopped ( in the shutdown mode ) and brought up after the configuration is completed with the advent of affordable fpga boards , students ' and hobbyists ' projects seek to recreate vintage computers or implement more novel architectures the quartus prime pro software also support hierarchical partial reconfiguration and simulation of partial reconfiguration often the reconfigurable array is used as a processing accelerator attached to a host processor one of the key challenges for reconfigurable computing is to enable higher design productivity and provide an easier way to use reconfigurable computing systems for users that are unfamiliar with the underlying concepts abstraction is a powerful mechanism to handle complex and different ( hardware ) tasks in a well-defined and common manner computing with memory glossary of reconfigurable computing iland project m-labs 1chipmsx piperench psoc sprinter

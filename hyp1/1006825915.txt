the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware the latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task , such as image processing or pattern matching , as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware this resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware bobda : introduction to reconfigurable computing : architectures ; springer , 2007 such as : copacobana , matrix , garp , hauser , john r and wawrzynek , john , '' garp : a mips processor with a reconfigurable coprocessor '' , proceedings of the ieee symposium on field-programmable custom computing machines ( fccm '97 , april 16â€“18 , 1997 ) , pp , '' a vliw processor with reconfigurable instruction set for embedded applications '' , solid-state circuits conference , 2003 1 , 2003 such designs were feasible due to the constant progress of silicon technology that let complex designs be implemented on one chip algotronix history later machines enabled first demonstrations of scientific principles , such as the spontaneous spatial self-organisation of genetic coding with meregen tredennick : the case for reconfigurable computing ; microprocessor report , vol computer scientist reiner hartenstein describes reconfigurable computing in terms of an anti-machine that , according to him , represents a fundamental paradigm shift away from the more conventional von neumann machine high-performance reconfigurable computing ( hprc ) is a computer architecture combining reconfigurable computing-based accelerators like field-programmable gate array with cpus or multi-core processors this has brought reconfigurable computing into the high-performance computing sphere furthermore , by replicating an algorithm on an fpga or the use of a multiplicity of fpgas has enabled reconfigurable simd systems to be produced where several computational devices can concurrently operate on different data , which is highly parallel computing commercial high-performance reconfigurable computing systems are beginning to emerge with the announcement of ibm integrating fpgas with its power processor partial reconfiguration allows for critical parts of the design to continue operating while a controller either on the fpga or off of it loads a partial design into a reconfigurable module typically the design modules are built along well defined boundaries inside the fpga that require the design to be specially mapped to the internal hardware fine-grained architectures work at the bit-level manipulation level ; whilst coarse grained processing elements ( reconfigurable datapath unit , rdpu ) are better optimised for standard data path applications intuitively , the slower the rate of reconfiguration the smaller the energy consumption as the associated energy cost of reconfiguration are amortised over a longer period of time some of the most intuitive designs use a peripheral bus to provide a coprocessor like arrangement for the reconfigurable array one of the key challenges for reconfigurable computing is to enable higher design productivity and provide an easier way to use reconfigurable computing systems for users that are unfamiliar with the underlying concepts computing with memory glossary of reconfigurable computing iland project m-labs 1chipmsx piperench psoc sprinter

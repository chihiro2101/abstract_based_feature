the concept of reconfigurable computing has existed since the 1960s , when gerald estrin 's paper proposed the concept of a computer made of a standard processor and an array of '' reconfigurable '' hardware , '' organization of computer systems—the fixed plus variable structure computer '' , proc the main processor would control the behavior of the reconfigurable hardware the latter would then be tailored to perform a specific task , such as image processing or pattern matching , as quickly as a dedicated piece of hardware once the task was done , the hardware could be adjusted to do some other task this resulted in a hybrid computer structure combining the flexibility of software with the speed of hardware in the 1980s and 1990s there was a renaissance in this area of research with many proposed reconfigurable architectures developed in industry and academia , c bobda : introduction to reconfigurable computing : architectures ; springer , 2007 such as : copacobana , matrix , garp , hauser , john r and wawrzynek , john , '' garp : a mips processor with a reconfigurable coprocessor '' , proceedings of the ieee symposium on field-programmable custom computing machines ( fccm '97 , april 16–18 , 1997 ) , pp the world 's first commercial reconfigurable computer , the algotronix chs2x4 , was completed in 1991 it was not a commercial success , but was promising enough that xilinx ( the inventor of the fpga , fpga ) bought the technology and hired the algotronix staff tredennick : the case for reconfigurable computing ; microprocessor report , vol computer scientist reiner hartenstein describes reconfigurable computing in terms of an anti-machine that , according to him , represents a fundamental paradigm shift away from the more conventional von neumann machine some supercomputer firms offer heterogeneous processing blocks including fpgas as accelerators in april 2011 the fourth many-core and reconfigurable supercomputing conference was held in europe commercial high-performance reconfigurable computing systems are beginning to emerge with the announcement of ibm integrating fpgas with its power processor electronic hardware , like software , can be designed modularly , by creating subcomponents and then higher-level components to instantiate them such projects are built with reconfigurable hardware ( fpgas ) , and some devices support emulation of multiple vintage computers using a single reconfigurable hardware ( c-one ) high granularity , which can also be known as fine-grained , often implies a greater flexibility when implementing algorithms into the hardware therefore , more coarse-grained architectures gain from potential lower energy requirements , as less information is transferred and utilised this can be relaxed by the concept of threads , allowing different tasks to run concurrently on this virtual hardware to exploit task level parallelism computing with memory glossary of reconfigurable computing iland project m-labs 1chipmsx piperench psoc sprinter

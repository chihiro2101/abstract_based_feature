the first soyuz mission with a crew , soyuz 1 , launched on 23 april 1967 but ended with a crash due to a parachute failure , killing astronaut vladimir komarov despite these early incidents , soyuz is widely considered the world 's safest , most cost-effective human spaceflight vehicle , established by its unparalleled length of operational history soyuz : the greatest spacecraft ever the best ride in the galaxy â€“ coming back to earth in a soyuz soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from salyut and later mir soviet space stations , and are now used for transport to and from the international space station ( iss ) at least one soyuz spacecraft is docked to iss at all times for use as an escape craft in the event of an emergency a soyuz spacecraft consists of three parts ( from front to back ) : a spheroid orbital module , which provides accommodation for the crew during their mission ; a small aerodynamic reentry module , which returns the crew to earth ; a cylindrical service module with solar panels attached , which contains the instruments and engines this allows smaller rockets to launch the spacecraft or can be used to increase the habitable space available to the crew in apollo cm vs in soyuz ) in the mass budget the spacecraft abort system ( sas ; could also be manually activated from the ground , but unlike american spacecraft , there was no way for the cosmonauts to trigger it themselves since it turned out to be almost impossible to separate the entire payload shroud from the soyuz service module cleanly , the decision was made to have the shroud split between the service module and descent module during an abort the only modification was in 1972 when the aerodynamic fairing over the sas motor nozzles was removed for weight-saving reasons as the redesigned soyuz 7k-t spacecraft carried extra life support equipment in 1983 , soyuz t-10a 's sas successfully rescued the cosmonauts from an on-pad fire and explosion of the launch vehicle most recently in 2018 , the sas sub-system in the payload shroud of soyuz ms-10 successfully rescued the cosmonauts from a rocket failure 2 minutes and 45 second after liftoff after the escape tower had already been jettisoned a hatch between it and the descent module can be closed so as to isolate it to act as an airlock if needed , crew members exiting through its side port ( near the descent module ) this separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module also the rescue of the crew whilst on the launch pad or with the sas system is complicated because of the orbital module separation of the orbital module is critical for a safe landing ; without separation of the orbital module , it is not possible for the crew to survive landing in the descent module in view of this , the orbital module was separated before the ignition of the return engine until the late 1980s the descent module , also known as a reentry capsule , is used for launch and the journey back to earth half of the descent module is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during reentry ; this half faces forward during reentry it is slowed initially by the atmosphere , then by a braking parachute , followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing the small dimensions of the descent module led to it having only two-man crews after the death of the soyuz 11 crew a non-pressurized part of the service module ( propulsion compartment , contains the main engine and a liquid-fuelled propulsion system for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to earth early soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously from the descent module soyuz 1 through soyuz 11 ( 1967 & ndash ; 1971 ) were first-generation vehicles , carrying a crew of up to three without spacesuits and distinguished from those following by their bent solar panels and their use of the igla automatic docking navigation system , which required special radar antennas thumb the second generation , called soyuz ferry or soyuz 7k-t , comprised soyuz 12 through soyuz 40 ( 1973 & ndash ; 1981 ) the new version debuted on 7 october 2010 with the launch of soyuz tma-01m , carrying the iss expedition 25 crew while not being direct derivatives of soyuz , the chinese shenzhou spacecraft uses soyuz tm technology sold in 1984 and the indian gaganyaan follow the same general layout as that pioneered by soyuz

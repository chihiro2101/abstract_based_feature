the first soyuz flight was uncrewed and started on 28 november 1966 the first soyuz mission with a crew , soyuz 1 , launched on 23 april 1967 but ended with a crash due to a parachute failure , killing astronaut vladimir komarov soyuz 3 , launched on 26 october 1968 , became the program 's first successful crewed mission the only other flight to suffer a fatal accident , soyuz 11 , killed its crew of three when the cabin depressurized prematurely just before reentry soyuz : the greatest spacecraft ever the best ride in the galaxy – coming back to earth in a soyuz soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from salyut and later mir soviet space stations , and are now used for transport to and from the international space station ( iss ) at least one soyuz spacecraft is docked to iss at all times for use as an escape craft in the event of an emergency the orbital and service modules are single-use and are destroyed upon atmospheric entry though this might seem wasteful , it reduces the amount of heat shielding required for reentry , saving mass compared to designs containing all of the living space and life support in a single capsule this allows smaller rockets to launch the spacecraft or can be used to increase the habitable space available to the crew in apollo cm vs in soyuz ) in the mass budget the orbital and reentry portions are habitable living space , with the service module containing the fuel , main engines and instrumentation soyuz can carry up to three crew members and provide life support for about 30 person days the vostok spacecraft utilized an ejector seat to bail out the cosmonaut in the event of a low-altitude launch failure , as well as during reentry , however it would probably have been ineffective in the first 20 seconds after liftoff when the altitude would be too low for the parachute to deploy the spacecraft abort system ( sas ; could also be manually activated from the ground , but unlike american spacecraft , there was no way for the cosmonauts to trigger it themselves the only modification was in 1972 when the aerodynamic fairing over the sas motor nozzles was removed for weight-saving reasons as the redesigned soyuz 7k-t spacecraft carried extra life support equipment there have been three failed launches of a crewed soyuz vehicle , soyuz 18a in 1975 , soyuz t-10a in 1983 and soyuz ms-10 in october 2018 on the latest soyuz versions ( since soyuz tm ) , a small window was introduced , providing the crew with a forward view however , after the problematic landing of soyuz tm-5 in september 1988 this procedure was changed and the orbital module is now separated after the return maneuver the descent module , also known as a reentry capsule , is used for launch and the journey back to earth it is slowed initially by the atmosphere , then by a braking parachute , followed by the main parachute which slows the craft for landing the best shape for this is a sphere – as the pioneering vostok spacecraft 's descent module used – but such a shape can provide no lift , which results in a purely atmospheric entry internal volume of soyuz sa is ; is usable for crew ( living space ) early soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously from the descent module reentry firing is usually done on the '' dawn '' side of the earth , so that the spacecraft can be seen by recovery helicopters as it descends in the evening twilight , illuminated by the sun when it is above the shadow of the earth these versions were named soyuz p , soyuz ppk , soyuz r , soyuz 7k-vi , and soyuz ois ( orbital research station ) thumb soyuz ms is the final planned upgrade of the soyuz spacecraft the uncrewed progress spacecraft are derived from soyuz and are used for servicing space stations

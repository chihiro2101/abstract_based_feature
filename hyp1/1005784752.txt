the first soyuz flight was uncrewed and started on 28 november 1966 the first soyuz mission with a crew , soyuz 1 , launched on 23 april 1967 but ended with a crash due to a parachute failure , killing astronaut vladimir komarov soyuz 3 , launched on 26 october 1968 , became the program 's first successful crewed mission the only other flight to suffer a fatal accident , soyuz 11 , killed its crew of three when the cabin depressurized prematurely just before reentry soyuz : the greatest spacecraft ever the best ride in the galaxy â€“ coming back to earth in a soyuz soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from salyut and later mir soviet space stations , and are now used for transport to and from the international space station ( iss ) at least one soyuz spacecraft is docked to iss at all times for use as an escape craft in the event of an emergency the spacecraft is intended to be replaced by the six-person orel spacecraft this allows smaller rockets to launch the spacecraft or can be used to increase the habitable space available to the crew in apollo cm vs in soyuz ) in the mass budget the orbital and reentry portions are habitable living space , with the service module containing the fuel , main engines and instrumentation this included developing a complex sensing system to monitor various launch vehicle parameters and trigger an abort if a booster malfunction occurred since it turned out to be almost impossible to separate the entire payload shroud from the soyuz service module cleanly , the decision was made to have the shroud split between the service module and descent module during an abort there have been three failed launches of a crewed soyuz vehicle , soyuz 18a in 1975 , soyuz t-10a in 1983 and soyuz ms-10 in october 2018 the forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module , also known as habitation section the module also contains a toilet , docking avionics and communications gear on the latest soyuz versions ( since soyuz tm ) , a small window was introduced , providing the crew with a forward view also the rescue of the crew whilst on the launch pad or with the sas system is complicated because of the orbital module separation of the orbital module is critical for a safe landing ; without separation of the orbital module , it is not possible for the crew to survive landing in the descent module this guaranteed that the descent module and orbital module would be separated before the descent module was placed in a reentry trajectory half of the descent module is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during reentry ; this half faces forward during reentry the later soyuz t spacecraft solved this issue later soyuz spacecraft detached the orbital module before firing the main engine , which saved propellant the soyuz 7k-l1 was designed to launch a crew from the earth to circle the moon , and was the primary hope for a soviet circumlunar flight thumb the second generation , called soyuz ferry or soyuz 7k-t , comprised soyuz 12 through soyuz 40 ( 1973 & ndash ; 1981 ) thumb the soyuz-tm crew transports ( m : were fourth generation soyuz spacecraft , and were used from 1986 to 2003 for ferry flights to mir and the international space station ( iss ) the soyuz tma-08m mission set a new record for the fastest crewed docking with a space station the uncrewed progress spacecraft are derived from soyuz and are used for servicing space stations

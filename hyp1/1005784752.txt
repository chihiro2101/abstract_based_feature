the first soyuz flight was uncrewed and started on 28 november 1966 the first soyuz mission with a crew , soyuz 1 , launched on 23 april 1967 but ended with a crash due to a parachute failure , killing astronaut vladimir komarov soyuz 3 , launched on 26 october 1968 , became the program 's first successful crewed mission the only other flight to suffer a fatal accident , soyuz 11 , killed its crew of three when the cabin depressurized prematurely just before reentry soyuz : the greatest spacecraft ever the best ride in the galaxy – coming back to earth in a soyuz soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from salyut and later mir soviet space stations , and are now used for transport to and from the international space station ( iss ) at least one soyuz spacecraft is docked to iss at all times for use as an escape craft in the event of an emergency the spacecraft is intended to be replaced by the six-person orel spacecraft this allows smaller rockets to launch the spacecraft or can be used to increase the habitable space available to the crew in apollo cm vs in soyuz ) in the mass budget the orbital and reentry portions are habitable living space , with the service module containing the fuel , main engines and instrumentation a new soyuz spacecraft must be made for every mission since it turned out to be almost impossible to separate the entire payload shroud from the soyuz service module cleanly , the decision was made to have the shroud split between the service module and descent module during an abort the only modification was in 1972 when the aerodynamic fairing over the sas motor nozzles was removed for weight-saving reasons as the redesigned soyuz 7k-t spacecraft carried extra life support equipment the forepart of the spacecraft is the orbital module , also known as habitation section separation of the orbital module is critical for a safe landing ; without separation of the orbital module , it is not possible for the crew to survive landing in the descent module however , after the problematic landing of soyuz tm-5 in september 1988 this procedure was changed and the orbital module is now separated after the return maneuver the descent module , also known as a reentry capsule , is used for launch and the journey back to earth a non-pressurized part of the service module ( propulsion compartment , contains the main engine and a liquid-fuelled propulsion system for maneuvering in orbit and initiating the descent back to earth early soyuz spacecraft would then have the service and orbital modules detach simultaneously from the descent module later soyuz spacecraft detached the orbital module before firing the main engine , which saved propellant this first generation encompassed the original soyuz 7k-ok and the soyuz 7k-oks for docking with the salyut 1 space station thumb the second generation , called soyuz ferry or soyuz 7k-t , comprised soyuz 12 through soyuz 40 ( 1973 & ndash ; 1981 ) soyuz 7k-tm was the spacecraft used in the apollo–soyuz in 1975 , which saw the first and only docking of a soyuz spacecraft with an apollo command and service module thumb the soyuz-tm crew transports ( m : were fourth generation soyuz spacecraft , and were used from 1986 to 2003 for ferry flights to mir and the international space station ( iss ) soyuz-tma looks identical to a soyuz-tm spacecraft on the outside , but interior differences allow it to accommodate taller occupants with new adjustable crew couches the new version debuted on 7 october 2010 with the launch of soyuz tma-01m , carrying the iss expedition 25 crew image : space shuttle vs soyuz tm - to scale drawing.png space shuttle orbiter and soyuz-tm ( drawn to scale ) .

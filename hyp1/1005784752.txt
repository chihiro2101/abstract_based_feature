the first soyuz mission with a crew , soyuz 1 , launched on 23 april 1967 but ended with a crash due to a parachute failure , killing astronaut vladimir komarov soyuz 3 , launched on 26 october 1968 , became the program 's first successful crewed mission despite these early incidents , soyuz is widely considered the world 's safest , most cost-effective human spaceflight vehicle , established by its unparalleled length of operational history soyuz : the greatest spacecraft ever the best ride in the galaxy â€“ coming back to earth in a soyuz soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from salyut and later mir soviet space stations , and are now used for transport to and from the international space station ( iss ) at least one soyuz spacecraft is docked to iss at all times for use as an escape craft in the event of an emergency this allows smaller rockets to launch the spacecraft or can be used to increase the habitable space available to the crew in apollo cm vs in soyuz ) in the mass budget a new soyuz spacecraft must be made for every mission soyuz can carry up to three crew members and provide life support for about 30 person days the life support system provides a nitrogen/oxygen atmosphere at sea level partial pressures the vehicle is protected during launch by a payload fairing , which is jettisoned along with the sas at minutes into launch the basic design of the sas has remained almost unchanged in 50 years of use and all soyuz launches carry it the only modification was in 1972 when the aerodynamic fairing over the sas motor nozzles was removed for weight-saving reasons as the redesigned soyuz 7k-t spacecraft carried extra life support equipment there have been three failed launches of a crewed soyuz vehicle , soyuz 18a in 1975 , soyuz t-10a in 1983 and soyuz ms-10 in october 2018 in 1983 , soyuz t-10a 's sas successfully rescued the cosmonauts from an on-pad fire and explosion of the launch vehicle this separation also lets the orbital module be customized to the mission with less risk to the life-critical descent module the convention of orientation in a micro-g environment differs from that of the descent module , as crew members stand or sit with their heads to the docking port separation of the orbital module is critical for a safe landing ; without separation of the orbital module , it is not possible for the crew to survive landing in the descent module the descent module , also known as a reentry capsule , is used for launch and the journey back to earth half of the descent module is covered by a heat-resistant covering to protect it during reentry ; this half faces forward during reentry the small dimensions of the descent module led to it having only two-man crews after the death of the soyuz 11 crew the later soyuz t spacecraft solved this issue an incomplete separation between the service and reentry modules led to emergency situations during soyuz 5 , soyuz tma-10 and soyuz tma-11 , which led to an incorrect reentry orientation ( crew ingress hatch first ) thumb thumb the crewed soyuz spacecraft can be classified into design generations thumb the soyuz-tm crew transports ( m : were fourth generation soyuz spacecraft , and were used from 1986 to 2003 for ferry flights to mir and the international space station ( iss ) the mission used a new six-hour rendezvous , faster than the previous soyuz launches , which had , since 1986 , taken two days the uncrewed progress spacecraft are derived from soyuz and are used for servicing space stations

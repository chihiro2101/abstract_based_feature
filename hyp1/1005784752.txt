the first soyuz mission with a crew , soyuz 1 , launched on 23 april 1967 but ended with a crash due to a parachute failure , killing astronaut vladimir komarov soyuz 3 , launched on 26 october 1968 , became the program 's first successful crewed mission the only other flight to suffer a fatal accident , soyuz 11 , killed its crew of three when the cabin depressurized prematurely just before reentry soyuz : the greatest spacecraft ever the best ride in the galaxy – coming back to earth in a soyuz soyuz spacecraft were used to carry cosmonauts to and from salyut and later mir soviet space stations , and are now used for transport to and from the international space station ( iss ) at least one soyuz spacecraft is docked to iss at all times for use as an escape craft in the event of an emergency this allows smaller rockets to launch the spacecraft or can be used to increase the habitable space available to the crew in apollo cm vs in soyuz ) in the mass budget the orbital and reentry portions are habitable living space , with the service module containing the fuel , main engines and instrumentation a new soyuz spacecraft must be made for every mission the spacecraft abort system ( sas ; could also be manually activated from the ground , but unlike american spacecraft , there was no way for the cosmonauts to trigger it themselves the basic design of the sas has remained almost unchanged in 50 years of use and all soyuz launches carry it the uncrewed progress resupply ferry has a dummy escape tower and removes the stabilizer fins from the payload shroud there have been three failed launches of a crewed soyuz vehicle , soyuz 18a in 1975 , soyuz t-10a in 1983 and soyuz ms-10 in october 2018 most recently in 2018 , the sas sub-system in the payload shroud of soyuz ms-10 successfully rescued the cosmonauts from a rocket failure 2 minutes and 45 second after liftoff after the escape tower had already been jettisoned on the latest soyuz versions ( since soyuz tm ) , a small window was introduced , providing the crew with a forward view the convention of orientation in a micro-g environment differs from that of the descent module , as crew members stand or sit with their heads to the docking port also the rescue of the crew whilst on the launch pad or with the sas system is complicated because of the orbital module this guaranteed that the descent module and orbital module would be separated before the descent module was placed in a reentry trajectory however , after the problematic landing of soyuz tm-5 in september 1988 this procedure was changed and the orbital module is now separated after the return maneuver this change was made as the tm-5 crew could not deorbit for 24 hours after they jettisoned their orbital module , which contained their sanitation facilities and the docking collar needed to attach to mir an incomplete separation between the service and reentry modules led to emergency situations during soyuz 5 , soyuz tma-10 and soyuz tma-11 , which led to an incorrect reentry orientation ( crew ingress hatch first ) since the soyuz tm-5 landing issue , the orbital module is once again detached only after the reentry firing , which led to ( but did not cause ) emergency situations of soyuz tma-10 and tma-11 it was designed for space station flights and had a docking port that allowed internal transfer between spacecraft soyuz 7k-tm was the spacecraft used in the apollo–soyuz in 1975 , which saw the first and only docking of a soyuz spacecraft with an apollo command and service module thumb the soyuz-tm crew transports ( m : were fourth generation soyuz spacecraft , and were used from 1986 to 2003 for ferry flights to mir and the international space station ( iss ) thumb soyuz ms is the final planned upgrade of the soyuz spacecraft image : space shuttle vs soyuz tm - to scale drawing.png space shuttle orbiter and soyuz-tm ( drawn to scale ) .

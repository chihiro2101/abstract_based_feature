the iao was established after admiral john poindexter , former united states national security advisor to president ronald reagan , and saic executive brian hicks approached the us department of defense with the idea for an information awareness program after the attacks of 9/11 poindexter and hicks had previously worked together on intelligence-technology programs for the defense advanced research projects agency the iao began funding research and development of the total information awareness ( tia ) program in february 2003 but renamed the program the terrorism information awareness program in may that year after an adverse media reaction to the program 's implications for public surveillance although tia was only one of several iao projects , many critics and news reports conflated tia with other related research projects of the iao , with the result that tia came in popular usage to stand for an entire subset of iao programs the tia program itself was the '' systems-level '' program of the iao that intended to integrate information technologies into a prototype system to provide tools to better detect , classify , and identify potential terrorists with the goal to increase the probability that authorized agencies of the united states could preempt adverse actions as a systems-level program of programs , tia 's goal was the creation of a '' counter-terrorism information architecture '' that integrated technologies from other iao programs ( and elsewhere , as appropriate ) among the other iao programs that were intended to provide tia with component data aggregation and automated analysis technologies were the genisys , genisys privacy protection , evidence extraction and link discovery , and scalable social network analysis programs poindexter gave a speech at darpatech 2002 entitled '' overview of the information awareness office '' overview of the information awareness office in which he described the tia program in addition to the program itself , the involvement of poindexter as director of the iao also raised concerns among some , since he had been earlier convicted of lying to congress and altering and destroying documents pertaining to the iran-contra affair , although those convictions were later overturned on the grounds that the testimony used against him was protected on january 16 , 2003 , senator russ feingold introduced legislation to suspend the activity of the iao and the total information awareness program pending a congressional review of privacy issues involved in february 2003 , congress passed legislation suspending activities of the iao pending a congressional report of the office 's activities ( consolidated appropriations resolution , 2003 , no.108–7 , division m , §111 ( b ) signed feb the global information society project in this report , iao changed the name of the program to the terrorism information awareness program and emphasized that the program was not designed to compile dossiers on us citizens , but rather to research and develop the tools that would allow authorized agencies to gather information on terrorist networks despite the name change and these assurances , the critics continued to see the system as prone to potential misuse or abuse evidence extraction and link discovery ( eeld ) developed technologies and tools for automated discovery , extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources ( such as phone call records from the nsa call database , internet histories , or bank records ) vast amounts of information were going to be collected and analyzed , and the available database technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data '' effective analysis across heterogenous databases '' means the ability to take things from databases which are designed to store different types of data—such as a database containing criminal records , a nsa call database and a foreign intelligence database the world wide web is considered an '' unstructured public data source '' because it is publicly accessible and contains many different types of data—such as blogs , emails , records of visits to web sites , etc.—all of which need to be analyzed and stored efficiently scalable social network analysis ( ssna ) aimed at developing techniques based on social network analysis for modeling the key characteristics of terrorist groups and discriminating these groups from other types of societal groups the total information awareness project lives on , technology review , 26 april 2006 , retrieved 27 july 2007 tia 's two core projects are now operated by advanced research and development

the iao was established after admiral john poindexter , former united states national security advisor to president ronald reagan , and saic executive brian hicks approached the us department of defense with the idea for an information awareness program after the attacks of 9/11 poindexter and hicks had previously worked together on intelligence-technology programs for the defense advanced research projects agency the iao began funding research and development of the total information awareness ( tia ) program in february 2003 but renamed the program the terrorism information awareness program in may that year after an adverse media reaction to the program 's implications for public surveillance although tia was only one of several iao projects , many critics and news reports conflated tia with other related research projects of the iao , with the result that tia came in popular usage to stand for an entire subset of iao programs the tia program itself was the '' systems-level '' program of the iao that intended to integrate information technologies into a prototype system to provide tools to better detect , classify , and identify potential terrorists with the goal to increase the probability that authorized agencies of the united states could preempt adverse actions as a systems-level program of programs , tia 's goal was the creation of a '' counter-terrorism information architecture '' that integrated technologies from other iao programs ( and elsewhere , as appropriate ) the tia program was researching , developing , and integrating technologies to virtually aggregate data , to follow subject-oriented link analysis , to develop descriptive and predictive models through data mining or human hypothesis , and to apply such models to additional datasets to identify terrorists and terrorist groups among the other iao programs that were intended to provide tia with component data aggregation and automated analysis technologies were the genisys , genisys privacy protection , evidence extraction and link discovery , and scalable social network analysis programs poindexter gave a speech at darpatech 2002 entitled '' overview of the information awareness office '' overview of the information awareness office in which he described the tia program in addition to the program itself , the involvement of poindexter as director of the iao also raised concerns among some , since he had been earlier convicted of lying to congress and altering and destroying documents pertaining to the iran-contra affair , although those convictions were later overturned on the grounds that the testimony used against him was protected on january 16 , 2003 , senator russ feingold introduced legislation to suspend the activity of the iao and the total information awareness program pending a congressional review of privacy issues involved evidence extraction and link discovery ( eeld ) developed technologies and tools for automated discovery , extraction and linking of sparse evidence contained in large amounts of classified and unclassified data sources ( such as phone call records from the nsa call database , internet histories , or bank records ) genisys aimed at developing technologies which would enable '' ultra-large , all-source information repositories '' vast amounts of information were going to be collected and analyzed , and the available database technology at the time was insufficient for storing and organizing such enormous quantities of data so they developed techniques for virtual data aggregation in order to support effective analysis across heterogeneous databases , as well as unstructured public data sources , such as the world wide web the world wide web is considered an '' unstructured public data source '' because it is publicly accessible and contains many different types of data—such as blogs , emails , records of visits to web sites , etc.—all of which need to be analyzed and stored efficiently the intent was to explore the feasibility of market-based trading mechanisms to predict political instability , threats to national security , and other major events in the near future then senate minority leader tom daschle said on the floor of the senate '' i could n't believe that we would actually commit 8 million to create a web site that would encourage investors to bet on futures involving terrorist attacks and public assassinations research was also started to focus on foreign language computer interaction for use in supporting coalition operations work on this project is conducted by saic through its former hicks & associates consulting arm , and run by former defense and military officials and which had originally been awarded us 19 million iao contract to build the prototype system in late 2002 in the following months , as more information emerged about the scope of the tia project , civil libertarians became concerned over what they saw as the potential for the development of an orwellian mass surveillance system communications assistance for law enforcement act echelon , nsa worldwide digital interception program fusion center government information

in 1785 , jeremy bentham , an english social reformer and founder of utilitarianism , travelled to krychaw in white russia ( modern belarus ) to visit his brother , samuel , who accompanied prince potemkin while residing with his brother in krichev , bentham sketched out the concept of the panopticon in letters back in england , bentham , with the assistance of his brother , continued to develop his theory on the panopticon prior to fleshing out his ideas of a panopticon prison , bentham had drafted a complete penal code and explored fundamental legal theory bentham thought that the chief mechanism that would bring the manager of the panopticon prison in line with the duty to be humane would be publicity bentham tried to put his duty and interest junction principle into practice by encouraging a public debate on prisons bentham 's inspection principle applied not only to the inmates of the panopticon prison , but also the manager bentham commissioned drawings from an architect , willey reveley bentham reasoned that if the prisoners of the panopticon prison could be seen but never knew when they were watched , the prisoners would need to follow the rules bentham also thought that reveley 's prison design could be used for factory , asylums , hospitals , and schools despite the fact that no panopticon was built during bentham 's lifetime , the principles he established on the panopticon prompted considerable discussion and debate he contrasted an english gothic architecture in 1400 with the same town in 1840 where broken spires and factory chimneys dominate the skyline , with a panopticon in the foreground replacing the christian hospice professor david rothman came to the conclusion that bentham 's panopticon prison did not inform the architecture of early asylums in the united states she argued that bentham 's pet gadget , the panopticon prison , was a device of such monstrous efficiency that it left no room for humanity recent libertarian thinkers began to regard bentham 's entire philosophy as having paved the way for totalitarian states in the mid-1970s , the panopticon was brought to the wider attention by the french psychoanalyst jacques-alain miller and the french philosopher michel foucault in 1975 foucault used the panopticon as metaphor for the modern disciplinary society in discipline and punish he argued that the disciplinary society had emerged in the 18th century and that discipline are techniques for assuring the ordering of human complexities , with the ultimate aim of docility and utility in the system foucault argued that discipline had crossed the technological threshold already in the late 18th century , when the right to observe and accumulate knowledge had been extended from the prison to hospitals , schools , and later factories of the telescreens in the landmark surveillance narrative nineteen eighty-four ( 1949 ) , george orwell said : '' there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment & nbsp ; in 1997 thomas mathiesen in turn expanded on foucault 's use of the panopticon metaphor when analysing the effects of mass media on society particular attention has been drawn to the similarities of cctv with bentham 's prison design because cctv technology enabled , in effect , a central observation tower , staffed by an unseen observer among the architectural references bentham quoted for his panopticon prison was ranelagh gardens , a london pleasure garden with a dome built around 1742 foucault 's theories positioned bentham 's panopticon prison in the social structures of 1970s europe

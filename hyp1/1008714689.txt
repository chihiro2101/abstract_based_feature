while residing with his brother in krichev , bentham sketched out the concept of the panopticon in letters back in england , bentham , with the assistance of his brother , continued to develop his theory on the panopticon prior to fleshing out his ideas of a panopticon prison , bentham had drafted a complete penal code and explored fundamental legal theory bentham thought that the chief mechanism that would bring the manager of the panopticon prison in line with the duty to be humane would be publicity bentham 's inspection principle applied not only to the inmates of the panopticon prison , but also the manager bentham commissioned drawings from an architect , willey reveley bentham reasoned that if the prisoners of the panopticon prison could be seen but never knew when they were watched , the prisoners would need to follow the rules bentham also thought that reveley 's prison design could be used for factory , asylums , hospitals , and schools despite the fact that no panopticon was built during bentham 's lifetime , the principles he established on the panopticon prompted considerable discussion and debate shortly after jeremy bentham 's death in 1832 his ideas were criticised by augustus pugin , who in 1841 published the second edition of his work contrasts in which one plate showed a '' modern poor house '' he contrasted an english gothic architecture in 1400 with the same town in 1840 where broken spires and factory chimneys dominate the skyline , with a panopticon in the foreground replacing the christian hospice professor david rothman came to the conclusion that bentham 's panopticon prison did not inform the architecture of early asylums in the united states she argued that bentham 's pet gadget , the panopticon prison , was a device of such monstrous efficiency that it left no room for humanity she accused bentham of forgetting the dangers of unrestrained power and argued that '' in his ardour for reform , bentham prepared the way for what he feared '' he argued that the disciplinary society had emerged in the 18th century and that discipline are techniques for assuring the ordering of human complexities , with the ultimate aim of docility and utility in the system he argued that discipline had replaced the pre-modern society of kings , and that the panopticon should not be understood as a building , but as a mechanism of power and a diagram of political technology the french sociologist henri lefebvre studied urban space and foucault 's interpretation of the panopticon prison , arriving at the conclusion that spatiality is a social phenomenon lefebvre contended , that architecture is no more than the relationship between the panopticon , people , and objects in urban studies , academics such as marc schuilenburg now argue that a different self-consciousness arises among humans who live in an urban area in 1997 thomas mathiesen in turn expanded on foucault 's use of the panopticon metaphor when analysing the effects of mass media on society he argued that mass media such as broadcast television gave many people the ability to view the few from their own homes and gaze upon the lives of reporters and celebrities however , the sociologist christian fuchs treats social media like a classical panopticon zamyatin goes beyond a concept of a single prison and projects panopticon principles to the whole society where people live in buildings with fully transparent walls foucault 's theories positioned bentham 's panopticon prison in the social structures of 1970s europe

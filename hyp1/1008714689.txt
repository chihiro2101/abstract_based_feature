in 1785 , jeremy bentham , an english social reformer and founder of utilitarianism , travelled to krychaw in white russia ( modern belarus ) to visit his brother , samuel , who accompanied prince potemkin while residing with his brother in krichev , bentham sketched out the concept of the panopticon in letters back in england , bentham , with the assistance of his brother , continued to develop his theory on the panopticon prior to fleshing out his ideas of a panopticon prison , bentham had drafted a complete penal code and explored fundamental legal theory bentham thought that the chief mechanism that would bring the manager of the panopticon prison in line with the duty to be humane would be publicity bentham 's inspection principle applied not only to the inmates of the panopticon prison , but also the manager bentham reasoned that if the prisoners of the panopticon prison could be seen but never knew when they were watched , the prisoners would need to follow the rules bentham also thought that reveley 's prison design could be used for factory , asylums , hospitals , and schools bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the panopticon scheme , convinced that it had been thwarted by the king and an aristocratic elite despite the fact that no panopticon was built during bentham 's lifetime , the principles he established on the panopticon prompted considerable discussion and debate shortly after jeremy bentham 's death in 1832 his ideas were criticised by augustus pugin , who in 1841 published the second edition of his work contrasts in which one plate showed a '' modern poor house '' professor david rothman came to the conclusion that bentham 's panopticon prison did not inform the architecture of early asylums in the united states she argued that bentham 's pet gadget , the panopticon prison , was a device of such monstrous efficiency that it left no room for humanity she accused bentham of forgetting the dangers of unrestrained power and argued that '' in his ardour for reform , bentham prepared the way for what he feared '' in the late 1960s , the american historian gertrude himmelfarb , who had published the haunted house of jeremy bentham in 1965 , was at the forefront of depicting bentham 's mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control he argued that discipline had replaced the pre-modern society of kings , and that the panopticon should not be understood as a building , but as a mechanism of power and a diagram of political technology foucault argued that discipline had crossed the technological threshold already in the late 18th century , when the right to observe and accumulate knowledge had been extended from the prison to hospitals , schools , and later factories the french sociologist henri lefebvre studied urban space and foucault 's interpretation of the panopticon prison , arriving at the conclusion that spatiality is a social phenomenon of the telescreens in the landmark surveillance narrative nineteen eighty-four ( 1949 ) , george orwell said : '' there was of course no way of knowing whether you were being watched at any given moment & nbsp ; she used the term 'panopticon ' because the workers could not tell that they were being spied on , while the manager was able to check their work continuously the panopticon has become a symbol of the extreme measures that some companies take in the name of efficiency as well as to guard against employee theft the concept of panopticon has been referenced in early discussions about the impact of social media foucault 's theories positioned bentham 's panopticon prison in the social structures of 1970s europe this led to the widespread use of the panopticon in literature , comic books , computer games , and tv series

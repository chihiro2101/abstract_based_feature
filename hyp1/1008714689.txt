in 1785 , jeremy bentham , an english social reformer and founder of utilitarianism , travelled to krychaw in white russia ( modern belarus ) to visit his brother , samuel , who accompanied prince potemkin while residing with his brother in krichev , bentham sketched out the concept of the panopticon in letters bentham applied his brother 's ideas on the constant observation of workers to prisons back in england , bentham , with the assistance of his brother , continued to develop his theory on the panopticon prior to fleshing out his ideas of a panopticon prison , bentham had drafted a complete penal code and explored fundamental legal theory bentham thought that the chief mechanism that would bring the manager of the panopticon prison in line with the duty to be humane would be publicity bentham 's inspection principle applied not only to the inmates of the panopticon prison , but also the manager bentham reasoned that if the prisoners of the panopticon prison could be seen but never knew when they were watched , the prisoners would need to follow the rules bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the panopticon scheme , convinced that it had been thwarted by the king and an aristocratic elite despite the fact that no panopticon was built during bentham 's lifetime , the principles he established on the panopticon prompted considerable discussion and debate professor david rothman came to the conclusion that bentham 's panopticon prison did not inform the architecture of early asylums in the united states in 1965 the conservative historian shirley robin letwin traced the fabian zest for social planning to early utilitarian thinkers she accused bentham of forgetting the dangers of unrestrained power and argued that '' in his ardour for reform , bentham prepared the way for what he feared '' david john manning published the mind of jeremy bentham in 1986 , in which he reasoned that bentham 's fear of instability caused him to advocate ruthless social engineering and a society in which there could be no privacy or tolerance for the deviant in 1975 foucault used the panopticon as metaphor for the modern disciplinary society in discipline and punish foucault first came across the panopticon architecture when he studied the origins of clinical medicine and hospital architecture in the second half of the 18th century he argued that discipline had replaced the pre-modern society of kings , and that the panopticon should not be understood as a building , but as a mechanism of power and a diagram of political technology foucault argued that discipline had crossed the technological threshold already in the late 18th century , when the right to observe and accumulate knowledge had been extended from the prison to hospitals , schools , and later factories the modern prison in the 1970s , with its corrective technology , was rooted in the changing legal powers of the state the french sociologist henri lefebvre studied urban space and foucault 's interpretation of the panopticon prison , arriving at the conclusion that spatiality is a social phenomenon the metaphor of the panopticon prison has been employed to analyse the social significance of surveillance by closed-circuit television ( cctv ) cameras in public spaces foucault 's use of the panopticon metaphor shaped the debate on workplace surveillance in the 1970s zamyatin goes beyond a concept of a single prison and projects panopticon principles to the whole society where people live in buildings with fully transparent walls foucault 's theories positioned bentham 's panopticon prison in the social structures of 1970s europe

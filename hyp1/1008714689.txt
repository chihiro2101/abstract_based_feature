in 1785 , jeremy bentham , an english social reformer and founder of utilitarianism , travelled to krychaw in white russia ( modern belarus ) to visit his brother , samuel , who accompanied prince potemkin while residing with his brother in krichev , bentham sketched out the concept of the panopticon in letters back in england , bentham , with the assistance of his brother , continued to develop his theory on the panopticon prior to fleshing out his ideas of a panopticon prison , bentham had drafted a complete penal code and explored fundamental legal theory while in his lifetime bentham was a prolific letter writer , he published little and remained obscure to the public until his death bentham thought that the chief mechanism that would bring the manager of the panopticon prison in line with the duty to be humane would be publicity bentham tried to put his duty and interest junction principle into practice by encouraging a public debate on prisons bentham 's inspection principle applied not only to the inmates of the panopticon prison , but also the manager bentham reasoned that if the prisoners of the panopticon prison could be seen but never knew when they were watched , the prisoners would need to follow the rules bentham also thought that reveley 's prison design could be used for factory , asylums , hospitals , and schools bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the panopticon scheme , convinced that it had been thwarted by the king and an aristocratic elite despite the fact that no panopticon was built during bentham 's lifetime , the principles he established on the panopticon prompted considerable discussion and debate shortly after jeremy bentham 's death in 1832 his ideas were criticised by augustus pugin , who in 1841 published the second edition of his work contrasts in which one plate showed a '' modern poor house '' his y-shape and cross-shape designs for workhouse expressed the panopticon principle by positioning the master 's room as central point professor david rothman came to the conclusion that bentham 's panopticon prison did not inform the architecture of early asylums in the united states in the mid-1970s , the panopticon was brought to the wider attention by the french psychoanalyst jacques-alain miller and the french philosopher michel foucault in 1975 foucault used the panopticon as metaphor for the modern disciplinary society in discipline and punish foucault first came across the panopticon architecture when he studied the origins of clinical medicine and hospital architecture in the second half of the 18th century the french sociologist henri lefebvre studied urban space and foucault 's interpretation of the panopticon prison , arriving at the conclusion that spatiality is a social phenomenon in 1984 michael radford gained international attention for the cinematographic panopticon he had staged in the film nineteen eighty-four the metaphor of the panopticon prison has been employed to analyse the social significance of surveillance by closed-circuit television ( cctv ) cameras in public spaces because the controlled is at the center and surrounded by those who watch , early surveillance studies treat social media as a reverse panopticon in modern academic literature on social media , terms like lateral surveillance , social searching , and social surveillance are employed to critically evaluate the effects of social media foucault 's theories positioned bentham 's panopticon prison in the social structures of 1970s europe

in 1785 , jeremy bentham , an english social reformer and founder of utilitarianism , travelled to krychaw in white russia ( modern belarus ) to visit his brother , samuel , who accompanied prince potemkin back in england , bentham , with the assistance of his brother , continued to develop his theory on the panopticon prior to fleshing out his ideas of a panopticon prison , bentham had drafted a complete penal code and explored fundamental legal theory bentham thought that the chief mechanism that would bring the manager of the panopticon prison in line with the duty to be humane would be publicity bentham 's inspection principle applied not only to the inmates of the panopticon prison , but also the manager bentham reasoned that if the prisoners of the panopticon prison could be seen but never knew when they were watched , the prisoners would need to follow the rules bentham also thought that reveley 's prison design could be used for factory , asylums , hospitals , and schools bentham remained bitter throughout his later life about the rejection of the panopticon scheme , convinced that it had been thwarted by the king and an aristocratic elite shortly after jeremy bentham 's death in 1832 his ideas were criticised by augustus pugin , who in 1841 published the second edition of his work contrasts in which one plate showed a '' modern poor house '' professor david rothman came to the conclusion that bentham 's panopticon prison did not inform the architecture of early asylums in the united states she argued that bentham 's pet gadget , the panopticon prison , was a device of such monstrous efficiency that it left no room for humanity she accused bentham of forgetting the dangers of unrestrained power and argued that '' in his ardour for reform , bentham prepared the way for what he feared '' in the late 1960s , the american historian gertrude himmelfarb , who had published the haunted house of jeremy bentham in 1965 , was at the forefront of depicting bentham 's mechanism of surveillance as a tool of oppression and social control in 1975 foucault used the panopticon as metaphor for the modern disciplinary society in discipline and punish he argued that the disciplinary society had emerged in the 18th century and that discipline are techniques for assuring the ordering of human complexities , with the ultimate aim of docility and utility in the system he argued that discipline had replaced the pre-modern society of kings , and that the panopticon should not be understood as a building , but as a mechanism of power and a diagram of political technology foucault argued that discipline had crossed the technological threshold already in the late 18th century , when the right to observe and accumulate knowledge had been extended from the prison to hospitals , schools , and later factories while acceptance for corporal punishment diminished , the state gained the right to administer more subtle methods of punishment , such as to observe the french sociologist henri lefebvre studied urban space and foucault 's interpretation of the panopticon prison , arriving at the conclusion that spatiality is a social phenomenon in the electronic eye : the rise of surveillance society ( 1994 ) the sociologist david lyon concluded that '' no single metaphor or model is adequate to the task of summing up what is central to contemporary surveillance , but important clues are available in nineteen eighty-four and in bentham 's panopticon '' the french philosopher gilles deleuze shaped the emerging field of surveillance studies with the 1990 essay postscript on the societies of control deleuze observed that technology had allowed physical enclosures , such as schools , factories , prisons and office buildings , to be replaced by a self-governing machine , which extends surveillance in a quest to manage production and consumption zamyatin goes beyond a concept of a single prison and projects panopticon principles to the whole society where people live in buildings with fully transparent walls foucault 's theories positioned bentham 's panopticon prison in the social structures of 1970s europe

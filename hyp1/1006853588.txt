though unread today , the pietist johann georg hamann held a strong influence in his day pietistic lutheranism gained patronage under archbishop erik benzelius , who encouraged the pietistic lutheran practices laestadian lutheranism , a form of pietistic lutheranism , continues to flourish in scandinavia , where church of sweden priest lars levi laestadius spearheaded the revival in the 19th century born at rappoltsweiler in alsace , now in france , on 13 january 1635 , trained by a devout godmother who used books of devotion like arndt 's true christianity , spener was convinced of the necessity of a moral and religious reformation within german lutheranism he studied theology at strasbourg , where the professors at the time ( and especially sebastian schmidt ) were more inclined to '' practical '' christianity than to theological disputation he afterwards spent a year in geneva , and was powerfully influenced by the strict moral life and rigid ecclesiastical discipline prevalent there , and also by the preaching and the piety of the waldensian professor antoine leger and the converted jesuit preacher jean de labadie during a stay in tübingen , spener read grossgebauer 's alarm cry , and in 1666 he entered upon his first pastoral charge at frankfurt with a profound opinion that the christian life within evangelical lutheranism was being sacrificed to zeal for rigid lutheran orthodoxy pietism , as a distinct movement in the german church , began with religious meetings at spener 's house ( collegia pietatis ) where he repeated his sermons , expounded passages of the new testament , and induced those present to join in conversation on religious questions in 1675 , spener published his pia desideria or earnest desire for a reform of the true evangelical church , the title giving rise to the term '' pietists '' three magistrates belonging to that society , one of whom was august hermann francke , subsequently the founder of the famous orphanage at halle ( 1695 ) , commenced courses of expository lectures on the scriptures of a practical and devotional character , and in the german language , which were zealously frequented by both students and townsmen the lectures , however , aroused the ill-will of the other theologians and pastors of leipzig , and francke and his friends left the city , and with the aid of christian thomasius and spener founded the new university of halle as a distinct movement , pietism had its greatest strength by the middle of the 18th century ;

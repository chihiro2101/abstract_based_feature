though unread today , the pietist johann georg hamann held a strong influence in his day pietistic lutheranism entered sweden in the 1600s after the writings of johann arndt , philipp jakob spener , and august hermann francke became popular pietistic lutheranism gained patronage under archbishop erik benzelius , who encouraged the pietistic lutheran practices born at rappoltsweiler in alsace , now in france , on 13 january 1635 , trained by a devout godmother who used books of devotion like arndt 's true christianity , spener was convinced of the necessity of a moral and religious reformation within german lutheranism he afterwards spent a year in geneva , and was powerfully influenced by the strict moral life and rigid ecclesiastical discipline prevalent there , and also by the preaching and the piety of the waldensian professor antoine leger and the converted jesuit preacher jean de labadie pietism , as a distinct movement in the german church , began with religious meetings at spener 's house ( collegia pietatis ) where he repeated his sermons , expounded passages of the new testament , and induced those present to join in conversation on religious questions the lectures , however , aroused the ill-will of the other theologians and pastors of leipzig , and francke and his friends left the city , and with the aid of christian thomasius and spener founded the new university of halle spener died in 1705 , but the movement , guided by francke and fertilized from halle , spread through the whole of middle and north germany yet some claim that pietism contributed largely to the revival of biblical studies in germany and to making religion once more an affair of the heart and of life and not merely of the intellect rudolf sohm claimed that '' it was the last great surge of the waves of the ecclesiastical movement begun by the reformation ;

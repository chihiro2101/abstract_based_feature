at the start of the second punic war , masinissa fought for carthage against syphax , the king of the masaesyli of western numidia ( present day algeria ) , who had allied himself with the romans masinissa , then about 17 years old , led an army of numidian troops and carthaginian auxiliaries against syphax 's army and won a decisive victory ( 215–212 bc ) after hasdrubal barca departed for italy , masinissa was placed in command of all the carthaginian cavalry in spain , where he fought a successful guerrilla warfare against the roman general scipio africanus ( scipio africanus ) throughout 208 and 207 , while mago barca and hasdrubal gisgo levied and trained new forces in c.206 bc , with fresh reinforcements , mago and hasdrubal gisgo—supported by masinissa 's numidian cavalry—met scipio at the battle of ilipa , where carthage 's power over hispania was forever broken in arguably scipio africanus 's most brilliant victory having lost the alliance with masinissa , hasdrubal started to look for another ally , which he found in syphax , who married sophonisba , hasdrubal 's daughter , who until the defection had been betrothed to masinissa at the battle of bagbrades ( 203 ) , scipio overcame hasdrubal and syphax and , while the roman general concentrated on carthage , gaius laelius and masinissa followed syphax to cirta , where he was captured and handed over to scipio at the battle of zama , masinissa commanded the cavalry ( 6,000 numidian and 3,000 roman ) on scipio 's right wing , scipio delayed the engagement long enough to allow for masinissa to join him the second punic war was over and for his services masinissa received the kingdom of syphax , and became king of numidia any hopes he may have had of extending his rule right across north africa were dashed , however , when a roman commission headed by the elderly cato the elder ( cato the elder ) came to africa about 155 bc to decide a territorial dispute between masinissa and carthage masinissa showed his displeasure when the roman army arrived in africa in 149 bc , but he died early in 148 bc without a breach in the alliance

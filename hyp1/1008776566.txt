at the start of the second punic war , masinissa fought for carthage against syphax , the king of the masaesyli of western numidia ( present day algeria ) , who had allied himself with the romans masinissa , then about 17 years old , led an army of numidian troops and carthaginian auxiliaries against syphax 's army and won a decisive victory ( 215–212 bc ) after his victory over syphax , masinissa commanded his skilled numidian cavalry against the romans in spain , where he was involved in the carthaginian victories of castulo and ilorca in 211 bc after hasdrubal barca departed for italy , masinissa was placed in command of all the carthaginian cavalry in spain , where he fought a successful guerrilla warfare against the roman general scipio africanus ( scipio africanus ) throughout 208 and 207 , while mago barca and hasdrubal gisgo levied and trained new forces in c.206 bc , with fresh reinforcements , mago and hasdrubal gisgo—supported by masinissa 's numidian cavalry—met scipio at the battle of ilipa , where carthage 's power over hispania was forever broken in arguably scipio africanus 's most brilliant victory the romans supported masinissa 's claim to the numidian throne against syphax , who was nevertheless successful in driving masinissa from power until scipio invaded africa in 204 at the battle of bagbrades ( 203 ) , scipio overcame hasdrubal and syphax and , while the roman general concentrated on carthage , gaius laelius and masinissa followed syphax to cirta , where he was captured and handed over to scipio after the defeat of syphax , masinissa married syphax 's wife sophonisba , but scipio , suspicious of her loyalty , demanded that she be taken to rome and appear in the triumphal parade at the battle of zama , masinissa commanded the cavalry ( 6,000 numidian and 3,000 roman ) on scipio 's right wing , scipio delayed the engagement long enough to allow for masinissa to join him masinissa showed his displeasure when the roman army arrived in africa in 149 bc , but he died early in 148 bc without a breach in the alliance

bohm was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , to a hungarian jewish immigrant father , samuel bohm , - by the numbers – david bohm and a lithuanian jewish mother he was raised mainly by his father , a furniture-store owner and assistant of the local rabbi bohm attended pennsylvania state college ( now pennsylvania state university ) , graduating in 1939 , and then the california institute of technology , for one year bohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of oppenheimer 's other graduate students ( giovanni rossi lomanitz , joseph weinberg , and max friedman ) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics he was active in communist and communist-backed organizations , including the young communist league , the campus committee to fight conscription , and the american peace mobilization during world war ii , the manhattan project mobilized much of berkeley 's physics research in the effort to produce the first atomic bomb during the war , bohm remained at berkeley , where he taught physics and conducted research in plasma , the synchrotron and the synchrocyclotron bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the calutrons at the y-12 facility in oak ridge , tennessee , which was used for the isotope separation electromagnetic for the bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945 after the war , bohm became an assistant professor at princeton university he also worked closely with albert einstein at the nearby institute for advanced study in may 1949 , the house un-american activities committee called upon bohm to testify because of his previous ties to unionism and suspected communists bohm invoked his fifth amendment right to refuse to testify , and he refused to give evidence against his colleagues after his acquittal , bohm 's colleagues sought to have him reinstated at princeton , but princeton president harold w dodds russell olwell : physics and politics in cold war america : the two exiles of david bohm , working paper number 20 bohm then left for brazil to assume a professorship of physics at the university of são paulo , at jayme tiomno 's invitation and on the recommendation of both einstein and oppenheimer during his early period , bohm made a number of significant contributions to physics , particularly quantum mechanics and relativity theory as a postgraduate at berkeley , he developed a theory of plasmas , discovering the electron phenomenon now known as bohm diffusion his first book , quantum theory , published in 1951 , was well received by einstein , among others but bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he wrote about in that book bohm 's aim was not to set out a deterministic , mechanical viewpoint but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality , in contrast to the conventional approach david bohm , basil hiley : the undivided universe : an ontological interpretation of quantum theory , edition published in the taylor & francis e-library 2009 ( first edition routledge , 1993 ) , , p bohm 's work and the epr paradox became the major factor motivating john stewart bell 's inequality , which rules out local hidden variable theories ; the full consequences of bell 's work are still being investigated & nbsp ; 1–34 , issn 0890-9997 , 2005 at the university of são paulo , bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952 yet the causal theory met much resistance and skepticism , with many physicists holding the copenhagen interpretation to be the only viable approach to quantum mechanics . bohm and aharonov form of the epr paradox in 1955 bohm relocated to israel , where he spent two years working at the technion , at haifa in 1957 , bohm and his student yakir aharonov published a new version of the epr paradox , reformulating the original argument in terms of spin in 1961 , bohm was made professor of theoretical physics at the university of london 's birkbeck college , becoming emeritus in 1987 a more recent and extensive examination of the relationship between the two men presents it in a more positive light and shows that bohm 's work in the psychological field was complementary to and compatible with his contributions to theoretical physics what is required in order to correct the distortions introduced by thought , according to bohm , is a form of proprioception , or self-awareness martin gardner reported this in a skeptical inquirer article and also critiqued the views of jiddu krishnamurti , with whom bohm had met in 1959 and had had many subsequent exchanges bohm 's wife consulted psychiatrist david shainberg , bohm 's longtime friend and collaborator , who agreed that electroconvulsive treatments were probably his only option infinite potential : the life and times of david bohm ( film ) www.infinitepotential.com , accessed 28 december 2020 thought as a system ( transcript of seminar held in ojai , california , from 30 november to 2 december 1990 ) , london : routledge the essential david bohm

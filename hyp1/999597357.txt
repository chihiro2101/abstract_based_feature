bohm was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , to a hungarian jewish immigrant father , samuel bohm , - by the numbers – david bohm and a lithuanian jewish mother bohm attended pennsylvania state college ( now pennsylvania state university ) , graduating in 1939 , and then the california institute of technology , for one year bohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of oppenheimer 's other graduate students ( giovanni rossi lomanitz , joseph weinberg , and max friedman ) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics he was active in communist and communist-backed organizations , including the young communist league , the campus committee to fight conscription , and the american peace mobilization during his time at the radiation laboratory , bohm was in a relationship with the future betty friedan and also helped to organize a local chapter of the federation of architects , engineers , chemists and technicians , a small labor union affiliated to the congress of industrial organizations ( cio ) during world war ii , the manhattan project mobilized much of berkeley 's physics research in the effort to produce the first atomic bomb during the war , bohm remained at berkeley , where he taught physics and conducted research in plasma , the synchrotron and the synchrocyclotron bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the calutrons at the y-12 facility in oak ridge , tennessee , which was used for the isotope separation electromagnetic for the bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945 he also worked closely with albert einstein at the nearby institute for advanced study in may 1949 , the house un-american activities committee called upon bohm to testify because of his previous ties to unionism and suspected communists bohm then left for brazil to assume a professorship of physics at the university of são paulo , at jayme tiomno 's invitation and on the recommendation of both einstein and oppenheimer during his early period , bohm made a number of significant contributions to physics , particularly quantum mechanics and relativity theory but bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he wrote about in that book starting from the realization that the wkb approximation of quantum mechanics leads to deterministic equations and convinced that a mere approximation could not turn a probabilistic theory into a deterministic theory , he doubted the inevitability of the conventional approach to quantum mechanics bohm 's aim was not to set out a deterministic , mechanical viewpoint but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality , in contrast to the conventional approach hiley : some remarks on the evolution of bohm 's proposals for an alternative to quantum mechanics , 30 january 2010 he initially called his approach a hidden variable theory , but he later called it ontological theory , reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found bohm 's work and the epr paradox became the major factor motivating john stewart bell 's inequality , which rules out local hidden variable theories ; the full consequences of bell 's work are still being investigated : science and exile : david bohm , the cold war , and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics , hsps , vol jean-pierre vigier traveled to são paulo , where he worked with bohm for three months ; ralph schiller , student of cosmologist peter bergmann , was his assistant for two years ; he worked with tiomno and walther schützer ; and mario bunge stayed to work with him for one year the brazilian cnpq explicitly supported his work on the causal theory and funded several researchers around bohm his work with vigier was the beginning of a long-standing cooperation between the two and louis de broglie , in particular , on connections to the hydrodynamics model proposed by madelung yet the causal theory met much resistance and skepticism , with many physicists holding the copenhagen interpretation to be the only viable approach to quantum mechanics in 1957 , bohm and his student yakir aharonov published a new version of the epr paradox , reformulating the original argument in terms of spin in 1959 , bohm and aharonov discovered the aharonov–bohm effect , showing how a magnetic field could affect a region of space in which the field had been shielded , but its vector potential did not vanish there that showed for the first time that the magnetic vector potential , hitherto a mathematical convenience , could have real physical ( quantum ) effects & nbsp ;

bohm was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , to a hungarian jewish immigrant father , samuel bohm , - by the numbers – david bohm and a lithuanian jewish mother bohm attended pennsylvania state college ( now pennsylvania state university ) , graduating in 1939 , and then the california institute of technology , for one year he then transferred to the theoretical physics group directed by robert oppenheimer at the university of california , berkeley radiation laboratory , where he obtained his doctorate bohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of oppenheimer 's other graduate students ( giovanni rossi lomanitz , joseph weinberg , and max friedman ) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics during the war , bohm remained at berkeley , where he taught physics and conducted research in plasma , the synchrotron and the synchrocyclotron & nbsp ; 64 ) , '' the scattering calculations ( of collisions of protons and deuterons ) that he had completed proved useful to the manhattan project and were immediately classified without security clearance , bohm was denied access to his own work ; not only would he be barred from defending his thesis , he was not even allowed to write his own thesis in the first place ! '' to satisfy the university , oppenheimer certified that bohm had successfully completed the research after the war , bohm became an assistant professor at princeton university bohm invoked his fifth amendment right to refuse to testify , and he refused to give evidence against his colleagues after his acquittal , bohm 's colleagues sought to have him reinstated at princeton , but princeton president harold w dodds russell olwell : physics and politics in cold war america : the two exiles of david bohm , working paper number 20 although einstein considered appointing him as his research assistant at the institute , oppenheimer ( who had served as the institute 's president since 1947 ) '' opposed the idea and his request to go to the university of manchester received einstein 's support but was unsuccessful during his early period , bohm made a number of significant contributions to physics , particularly quantum mechanics and relativity theory his first book , quantum theory , published in 1951 , was well received by einstein , among others but bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he wrote about in that book hiley : zeno paradox for bohmian trajectories : the unfolding of the metatron , 3 january 2011 ( pdf & nbsp ; – retrieved 16 february 2012 ) hiley : some remarks on the evolution of bohm 's proposals for an alternative to quantum mechanics , 30 january 2010 he began to develop his own interpretation ( the de broglie–bohm theory , also called the pilot wave theory ) , the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory he initially called his approach a hidden variable theory , but he later called it ontological theory , reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found bohm and his colleague basil hiley later stated that they had found their own choice of terms of an '' interpretation in terms of hidden variables '' to be too restrictive , especially since their variables , position , and momentum '' are not actually hidden '' david bohm , basil hiley : the undivided universe : an ontological interpretation of quantum theory , edition published in the taylor & francis e-library 2009 ( first edition routledge , 1993 ) , , p & nbsp ; 36 , part & nbsp ; 1 , pp the brazilian cnpq explicitly supported his work on the causal theory and funded several researchers around bohm yet the causal theory met much resistance and skepticism , with many physicists holding the copenhagen interpretation to be the only viable approach to quantum mechanics & nbsp ; 1070–1076 ( abstract ) it was that form of the epr paradox that was discussed by john stewart bell in his famous paper of 1964 in 1959 , bohm and aharonov discovered the aharonov–bohm effect , showing how a magnetic field could affect a region of space in which the field had been shielded , but its vector potential did not vanish there that showed for the first time that the magnetic vector potential , hitherto a mathematical convenience , could have real physical ( quantum ) effects david peat : science , order , and creativity , 1987 in the view of bohm and hiley , '' things , such as particles , objects , and indeed subjects '' exist as '' semi-autonomous quasi-local features '' of an underlying activity hiley : process and the implicate order : their relevance to quantum theory and mind bohm 's prolonged involvement with the philosophy of krishnamurti was regarded somewhat skeptically by some of his scientific peers the mature expression of bohm 's views in the psychological field was presented in a seminar conducted in 1990 at the oak grove school , founded by krishnamurti in ojai , california david peat , infinite potential : the life and times of david bohm , reading , massachusetts : addison wesley , 1997 , pp in the early 1950s , bohm 's causal quantum theory of hidden variables was mostly negatively received , with a widespread tendency among physicists to systematically ignore both bohm personally and his ideas the unity of everything : a conversation with david bohm , with nish dubashia

bohm was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , to a hungarian jewish immigrant father , samuel bohm , - by the numbers – david bohm and a lithuanian jewish mother bohm attended pennsylvania state college ( now pennsylvania state university ) , graduating in 1939 , and then the california institute of technology , for one year during his time at the radiation laboratory , bohm was in a relationship with the future betty friedan and also helped to organize a local chapter of the federation of architects , engineers , chemists and technicians , a small labor union affiliated to the congress of industrial organizations ( cio ) during the war , bohm remained at berkeley , where he taught physics and conducted research in plasma , the synchrotron and the synchrocyclotron & nbsp ; 64 ) , '' the scattering calculations ( of collisions of protons and deuterons ) that he had completed proved useful to the manhattan project and were immediately classified bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the calutrons at the y-12 facility in oak ridge , tennessee , which was used for the isotope separation electromagnetic for the bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945 in may 1949 , the house un-american activities committee called upon bohm to testify because of his previous ties to unionism and suspected communists bohm invoked his fifth amendment right to refuse to testify , and he refused to give evidence against his colleagues dodds russell olwell : physics and politics in cold war america : the two exiles of david bohm , working paper number 20 although einstein considered appointing him as his research assistant at the institute , oppenheimer ( who had served as the institute 's president since 1947 ) '' opposed the idea and : science and exile : david bohm , the cold war , and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics , hsps , vol bohm then left for brazil to assume a professorship of physics at the university of são paulo , at jayme tiomno 's invitation and on the recommendation of both einstein and oppenheimer quantum theory and bohm diffusion during his early period , bohm made a number of significant contributions to physics , particularly quantum mechanics and relativity theory as a postgraduate at berkeley , he developed a theory of plasmas , discovering the electron phenomenon now known as bohm diffusion his first book , quantum theory , published in 1951 , was well received by einstein , among others bohm 's aim was not to set out a deterministic , mechanical viewpoint but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality , in contrast to the conventional approach hiley : some remarks on the evolution of bohm 's proposals for an alternative to quantum mechanics , 30 january 2010 he began to develop his own interpretation ( the de broglie–bohm theory , also called the pilot wave theory ) , the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory he initially called his approach a hidden variable theory , but he later called it ontological theory , reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found david bohm , basil hiley : the undivided universe : an ontological interpretation of quantum theory , edition published in the taylor & francis e-library 2009 ( first edition routledge , 1993 ) , , p the brazilian cnpq explicitly supported his work on the causal theory and funded several researchers around bohm yet the causal theory met much resistance and skepticism , with many physicists holding the copenhagen interpretation to be the only viable approach to quantum mechanics from 1951 to 1953 , bohm and david pines published the articles in which they introduced the random phase approximation and proposed the plasmon . bohm and aharonov form of the epr paradox aharonov ( 1957 ) , discussion of experimental proof for the paradox of einstein , rosen , and podolsky , phys in 1957 , bohm relocated to the united kingdom as a research fellow at the university of bristol in 1959 , bohm and aharonov discovered the aharonov–bohm effect , showing how a magnetic field could affect a region of space in which the field had been shielded , but its vector potential did not vanish there in 1961 , bohm was made professor of theoretical physics at the university of london 's birkbeck college , becoming emeritus in 1987 implicate and explicate order at birkbeck college , much of the work of bohm and basil hiley expanded on the notion of implicate , explicate , and generative orders proposed by bohm & nbsp ; 171–183 , , abstract david bohm , f in his book science , order and creativity , bohm referred to the views of various biologists on the evolution of the species , including rupert sheldrake bohm suggested that if the '' dialogue groups '' were experienced on a sufficiently-wide scale , they could help overcome the isolation and fragmentation that bohm observed in society infinite potential : the life and times of david bohm ( film ) www.infinitepotential.com , accessed 28 december 2020

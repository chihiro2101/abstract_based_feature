bohm was born in wilkes-barre , pennsylvania , to a hungarian jewish immigrant father , samuel bohm , - by the numbers – david bohm and a lithuanian jewish mother despite being raised in a jewish family , he became an agnostic in his teenage years bohm attended pennsylvania state college ( now pennsylvania state university ) , graduating in 1939 , and then the california institute of technology , for one year he then transferred to the theoretical physics group directed by robert oppenheimer at the university of california , berkeley radiation laboratory , where he obtained his doctorate bohm lived in the same neighborhood as some of oppenheimer 's other graduate students ( giovanni rossi lomanitz , joseph weinberg , and max friedman ) and with them became increasingly involved in radical politics during his time at the radiation laboratory , bohm was in a relationship with the future betty friedan and also helped to organize a local chapter of the federation of architects , engineers , chemists and technicians , a small labor union affiliated to the congress of industrial organizations ( cio ) during world war ii , the manhattan project mobilized much of berkeley 's physics research in the effort to produce the first atomic bomb during the war , bohm remained at berkeley , where he taught physics and conducted research in plasma , the synchrotron and the synchrocyclotron & nbsp ; 64 ) , '' the scattering calculations ( of collisions of protons and deuterons ) that he had completed proved useful to the manhattan project and were immediately classified without security clearance , bohm was denied access to his own work ; not only would he be barred from defending his thesis , he was not even allowed to write his own thesis in the first place ! '' to satisfy the university , oppenheimer certified that bohm had successfully completed the research bohm later performed theoretical calculations for the calutrons at the y-12 facility in oak ridge , tennessee , which was used for the isotope separation electromagnetic for the bomb dropped on hiroshima in 1945 bohm invoked his fifth amendment right to refuse to testify , and he refused to give evidence against his colleagues dodds russell olwell : physics and politics in cold war america : the two exiles of david bohm , working paper number 20 : science and exile : david bohm , the cold war , and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics , hsps , vol during his early period , bohm made a number of significant contributions to physics , particularly quantum mechanics and relativity theory his first book , quantum theory , published in 1951 , was well received by einstein , among others but bohm became dissatisfied with the orthodox interpretation of quantum theory he wrote about in that book hiley : zeno paradox for bohmian trajectories : the unfolding of the metatron , 3 january 2011 ( pdf & nbsp ; – retrieved 16 february 2012 ) bohm 's aim was not to set out a deterministic , mechanical viewpoint but to show that it was possible to attribute properties to an underlying reality , in contrast to the conventional approach he began to develop his own interpretation ( the de broglie–bohm theory , also called the pilot wave theory ) , the predictions of which agreed perfectly with the non-deterministic quantum theory he initially called his approach a hidden variable theory , but he later called it ontological theory , reflecting his view that a stochastic process underlying the phenomena described by his theory might one day be found bohm and his colleague basil hiley later stated that they had found their own choice of terms of an '' interpretation in terms of hidden variables '' to be too restrictive , especially since their variables , position , and momentum '' are not actually hidden '' david bohm , basil hiley : the undivided universe : an ontological interpretation of quantum theory , edition published in the taylor & francis e-library 2009 ( first edition routledge , 1993 ) , , p : science and exile : david bohm , the cold war , and a new interpretation of quantum mechanics , hsps , vol & nbsp ; 1–34 , issn 0890-9997 , 2005 at the university of são paulo , bohm worked on the causal theory that became the subject of his publications in 1952 his work with vigier was the beginning of a long-standing cooperation between the two and louis de broglie , in particular , on connections to the hydrodynamics model proposed by madelung from 1951 to 1953 , bohm and david pines published the articles in which they introduced the random phase approximation and proposed the plasmon . bohm and aharonov form of the epr paradox & nbsp ; 1070–1076 ( abstract ) it was that form of the epr paradox that was discussed by john stewart bell in his famous paper of 1964 in that picture , the classical limit for quantum phenomena , in terms of a condition that the action function is not much greater than planck 's constant , indicates one such criterion what is required in order to correct the distortions introduced by thought , according to bohm , is a form of proprioception , or self-awareness gardner said that bohm 's view of the interconnectedness of mind and matter ( on one occasion , he summarized : '' even the electron is informed with a certain level of mind there was a significant revival of interest in bohm 's ideas in the late 1950s and the early 1960s ; the ninth symposium of the colston research society in bristol in 1957 was a key turning point toward greater tolerance of his ideas unfolding meaning : a weekend of dialogue with david bohm ( donald factor , editor ) , gloucestershire : foundation house , , 1987 ark paperback : , 1996 routledge paperback : 1985 the essential david bohm

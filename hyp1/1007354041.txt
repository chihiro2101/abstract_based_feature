a horse with intermixed white and colored hairs of any color is usually called a roan however , such mixtures , which can appear superficially similar , are caused by a number of separate genetic factors identifiable types of roans include true or classic roan , varnish roan , and rabicano , though other currently unknown factors may be responsible for ambiguous '' roaning '' gray horses , which become lighter as they age until their hair coat is nearly completely white , may be confused with roans when they are young duns , which are solid-colored horses affected by the dun dilution gene on their bodies but with darker points , are also sometimes confused with roans , but they do not have the intermixed white and colored hairs of a roan horses with the classic or true roan pattern may be any base color which is intermingled with unpigmented white hairs on the body descriptions of roan coat colors are as follows : red roan or strawberry roan describes true or classic roan on a chestnut base coat bay roan is true roan on a bay coat '' blue roan is true roan on a black coat a varnish roan is not a true roan ; it is actually one of the leopard complex coat patterns associated with appaloosa , knabstrupper , noriker horse and related breeds sometimes called ticking , rabicano is common even in breeds that do not have true or classic roan , including arabians and thoroughbreds this is in stark contrast to true roan horses and roan cattle , which are roan only in pigmented regions of their coat and may have white markings in 1957 , little suggested that roan and ticking were controlled separately , and postulated that roan may have been homologous to '' silvered '' coat in mice among the former , coat color may be solid black , solid white , or blue roan ; the latter may be solid red , solid white , or red roan

a horse with intermixed white and colored hairs of any color is usually called a roan identifiable types of roans include true or classic roan , varnish roan , and rabicano , though other currently unknown factors may be responsible for ambiguous '' roaning horses with the classic or true roan pattern may be any base color which is intermingled with unpigmented white hairs on the body descriptions of roan coat colors are as follows : red roan or strawberry roan describes true or classic roan on a chestnut base coat the mane and tail remain red or have only a few white hairs , while the body ranges from nearly chestnut to pinkish bay roan is true roan on a bay coat '' blue roan is true roan on a black coat however , grays fade with age , while roans do not ; and grullos are blue duns and possess dun markings but not intermingled white hairs a varnish roan is not a true roan ; it is actually one of the leopard complex coat patterns associated with appaloosa , knabstrupper , noriker horse and related breeds some forms of sabino , which is a pinto pattern , have roaning along the edges of other white spots or markings a roan horse may not fit into any of the traditional categories as there is much still to be learned about the genetics of roan this is in stark contrast to true roan horses and roan cattle , which are roan only in pigmented regions of their coat and may have white markings in 1957 , little suggested that roan and ticking were controlled separately , and postulated that roan may have been homologous to '' silvered '' coat in mice '' in 2007 , the gene responsible for roan cattle ( kitlg ) was refuted as a possible cause of roan in dogs roan cattle can not '' breed true '' but breeding white cattle to a solid mate will always yield a roan calf

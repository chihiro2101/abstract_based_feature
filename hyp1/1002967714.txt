ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 palmer , ibm 's 360 and early 370 systems , mit press , 1991 , pp 23-34 at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , an ibm 701 meant that scientists could run nuclear explosives computations faster the first 701 was delivered to ibm 's world headquarters in new york '' i think there is a world market for maybe five computers '' is often attributed to thomas watson , senior in 1943 and junior at several dates in the 1950s this misquote is from the 1953 ibm annual stockholders ' meeting was describing the market acceptance of the ibm 701 computer the successor of the 701 was the index register-equipped ibm 704 , introduced 4 years after the 701 in 1952 ibm paired with language scholars from georgetown university to develop a translation software for use on computers the program , which was developed for play on the ibm 701 , was demonstrated to the public on television the lawrence livermore national laboratory developed a language compilation and runtime system called the kompiler for their ibm 701 the language was developed by john backus in 1953 for the ibm 701 to support computation with floating point the fortran compiler also developed by backus was not released by ibm until the ibm 704 ibm world headquarters , new york , n.y the ibm 701 had only two programmer accessible registers : the accumulator was 38 bits long ( adding two overflow bits ) amdahl discusses his role in the design of several computers for ibm including the ibm 701 , the ibm 704 and the stretch

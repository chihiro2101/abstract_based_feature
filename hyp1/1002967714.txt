ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment palmer , ibm 's 360 and early 370 systems , mit press , 1991 , pp 23-34 at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , an ibm 701 meant that scientists could run nuclear explosives computations faster the first 701 was delivered to ibm 's world headquarters in new york in 1952 ibm paired with language scholars from georgetown university to develop a translation software for use on computers the program , which was developed for play on the ibm 701 , was demonstrated to the public on television self-proclaimed checkers master robert nealey played the game on an ibm 7094 computer in 1962 and the computer won the lawrence livermore national laboratory developed a language compilation and runtime system called the kompiler for their ibm 701 speedcode was the first high-level programming language created for an ibm computer the language was developed by john backus in 1953 for the ibm 701 to support computation with floating point the fortran compiler also developed by backus was not released by ibm until the ibm 704 ibm world headquarters , new york , n.y the williams tube memory and later core memory each had a memory cycle time of 12 microseconds the ibm 701 had only two programmer accessible registers : the accumulator was 38 bits long ( adding two overflow bits ) amdahl discusses his role in the design of several computers for ibm including the ibm 701 , the ibm 704 and the stretch

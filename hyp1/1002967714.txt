ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment palmer , ibm 's 360 and early 370 systems , mit press , 1991 , pp 23-34 at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , an ibm 701 meant that scientists could run nuclear explosives computations faster the first 701 was delivered to ibm 's world headquarters in new york was describing the market acceptance of the ibm 701 computer before production began , watson visited with 20 companies that were potential customers on january 7 , 1954 , the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the ibm 701 computer to translate from russian to english the mark 1 translating device , which was developed for the us air force , was able to produce its first automated russian-to-english translation in 1959 and was shown to the public in 1964 the program , which was developed for play on the ibm 701 , was demonstrated to the public on television self-proclaimed checkers master robert nealey played the game on an ibm 7094 computer in 1962 and the computer won it is still considered a milestone for artificial intelligence and it offered the public during the early 1960s an example of the capabilities of an electronic computer speedcode was the first high-level programming language created for an ibm computer the language was developed by john backus in 1953 for the ibm 701 to support computation with floating point the first magnetic tape drives were used on the tape processing machine ( tpm ) and then adapted to the 701 amdahl discusses his role in the design of several computers for ibm including the ibm 701 , the ibm 704 and the stretch

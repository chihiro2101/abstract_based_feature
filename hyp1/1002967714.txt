ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment palmer , ibm 's 360 and early 370 systems , mit press , 1991 , pp the first 701 was delivered to ibm 's world headquarters in new york this misquote is from the 1953 ibm annual stockholders ' meeting was describing the market acceptance of the ibm 701 computer on january 7 , 1954 , the team developed an experimental software program that allowed the ibm 701 computer to translate from russian to english the ibm 701 can claim to be the first computer displaying the potential of artificial intelligence in arthur samuel 's checkers-playing program on february 24 , 1956 self-proclaimed checkers master robert nealey played the game on an ibm 7094 computer in 1962 and the computer won the lawrence livermore national laboratory developed a language compilation and runtime system called the kompiler for their ibm 701 speedcode was the first high-level programming language created for an ibm computer the fortran compiler also developed by backus was not released by ibm until the ibm 704 ibm world headquarters , new york , n.y memory could be expanded to a maximum of 4096 words of 36 bits by the addition of a second set of 72 williams tubes or ( later ) by replacing the entire memory with magnetic-core memory amdahl discusses his role in the design of several computers for ibm including the ibm 701 , the ibm 704 and the stretch he discusses his work with nathaniel rochester and ibm 's management of the design process for computers

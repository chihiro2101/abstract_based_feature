ibm 701 competed with remington rand 's univac 1103 in the scientific computation market , which had been developed for the nsa , so it was held secret until permission to market it was obtained in 1951 based on the trials , the two machines had comparable computational speed , with a slight advantage for ibm 's machine , but the univac was favored unanimously for its significantly faster input-output equipment palmer , ibm 's 360 and early 370 systems , mit press , 1991 , pp 23-34 at the lawrence livermore national laboratory , an ibm 701 meant that scientists could run nuclear explosives computations faster the first 701 was delivered to ibm 's world headquarters in new york was describing the market acceptance of the ibm 701 computer in 1952 ibm paired with language scholars from georgetown university to develop a translation software for use on computers the program , which was developed for play on the ibm 701 , was demonstrated to the public on television self-proclaimed checkers master robert nealey played the game on an ibm 7094 computer in 1962 and the computer won it is still considered a milestone for artificial intelligence and it offered the public during the early 1960s an example of the capabilities of an electronic computer speedcode was the first high-level programming language created for an ibm computer the language was developed by john backus in 1953 for the ibm 701 to support computation with floating point the fortran compiler also developed by backus was not released by ibm until the ibm 704 the ibm 701 system was composed of the following units : ibm 701 - analytical control unit ( cpu ) ibm 706 - electrostatic storage unit ( 2048 words of williams tube memory ) ibm 711 - punched card reader ( 150 cards/min ibm 700/7000 series list of ibm products list of vacuum tube computers share ( computing ) strela computer , comparable soviet design amdahl discusses his role in the design of several computers for ibm including the ibm 701 , the ibm 704 and the stretch

brothers jim and william reid had been inspired to form a band as far back as 1977 , having heard groups of the british punk scene ; in the early 1980s they formed their own '' before forming the band , the brothers had spent five years on the dole , during which they wrote and recorded songs at home and worked out the sound and image of the band other accounts suggest that the name derived from an offer on a breakfast cereal packet , where customers could send off for a gold jesus & mary chain early influences included the velvet underground , the stooges , and the shangri-las , william stating in 1985 , '' we all love the shangri-las , and one day we 're going to make shangri-las records early demos displayed a similarity to the ramones , prompting the brothers to add another element to their sound ; in william 's words : '' that 's why we started using noise and feedback in the early days william reid 's guitar would be left out of tune , while dalglish 's drum kit was limited to two drums , and hart 's bass guitar only had three strings , down to two by 1985 ; in hart 's words , '' that 's the two i use '' sky news interview , 1985 struggling to get gigs , the band took to turning up at venues claiming to be the support band , playing their short set and making a quick exit on the strength of hearing the band sound check , mcgee signed them to his creation records label on a one-off deal , and mcgee also became the band 's manager their debut single , '' upside down '' , was recorded in october and released in november that year dalglish left in november 1984 after a dispute over money and was replaced shortly afterwards by bobby gillespie who had also formed primal scream two years earlier in 1982 in late december 1984 , the band performed as part of the ica rock week during their performance , bottles were thrown on stage , with press reports exaggerating events and claiming that there had been a riot , and national newspaper the sun running a story on the band concentrating on violence and drugs , the band attracting the tag '' the new sex pistols '' the label had initially refused to press the single due to its b-side , '' suck '' , but went ahead given the alternative put forward by the band , a song called '' jesus fuck '' the band were eager to get '' jesus fuck '' released , and alan mcgee got as far as producing test pressings of a re-issue of '' upside down '' with the song on the b-side , before the band insisted that blanco y negro include the track on their next single he had recorded most of the drums on psychocandy , with john moore filling in when gillespie was unavailable , eventually joining the band to replace him such behaviour became expected of the band and many shows culminated with the reids trashing their equipment , which was often followed by the audience throwing projectiles onto the stage and damaging equipment on 15 march 1985 , the jesus and mary chain played a gig at the north london polytechnic in front of one of their largest crowds up to that point the venue blamed the band 's late appearance and two equipment breakdowns , while mcgee issued a statement saying that '' the audience were not smashing up the hall , they were smashing up pop music '' , going on to say '' this is truly art as terrorism '' the violence soon started to become a hindrance to the band , with people attending concerts simply for the violence rather than the music , william commenting '' i hate it , i despise it many performances were cancelled during the remainder of 1985 , with promoters or local councils not prepared to risk a riot the band revived their acoustic intentions with a stripped-down session for john peel in november 1985 , which included '' psychocandy '' , the original album title track that was omitted from the release , and '' some candy talking '' , a song which they had been performing for over a year , but had left off the album a second version of '' some candy talking '' was issued on a free ep issued with the nme in january 1986 , and the song was released as the band 's next single in july in september 1986 , the band parted ways with manager alan mcgee , and came close to splitting up later in the year , with jim reid suffering from '' exhaustion '' the first fruits of these sessions were released on the '' april skies '' single in april , which saw the band have their first top ten hit '' happy when it rains '' was the second pre-album single , strongly influenced by smokey robinson 's '' my girl '' , but it failed to match the success of '' april skies '' , only reaching number twenty-five the band set out on another uk tour , this time with sets stretching to 45 minutes , although to a mixed reaction from the music press the band 's second album , darklands , was released during the tour , in september , described by writer steve taylor as '' the definitive blend of light and shade '' featuring a more melodic sound , the album was recorded almost entirely by the reids themselves , replacing live drums with a drum machine , and received overwhelmingly positive reviews by the british music press with the court case hanging over the band , they compiled a collection of b-sides and rarities for release in april 1988 as barbed wire kisses their next release was the new recording '' sidewalking '' , released in march 1988 , and backed by some the live tracks , followed a month later by barbed wire kisses in an interview to uncut magazine , jim reid announced that a new album by the band was in the works the jesus and mary chain also performed two gigs in tel aviv on 19 and 20 october in march 2014 the band signed back to alan mcgee and became the first artists to sign to the newly reformed creation management in september 2015 , jim reid announced that the band were recording their first studio album since 1998 the song '' april skies '' was featured in the amc tv series the walking dead in a scene from the episode entitled '' stradivarius ''

in william 's words : '' that 's why we started using noise and feedback after failing to generate any interest from concert promoters and record labels in scotland , the band relocated to fulham , london , in may 1984 , and soon afterwards their demo tape was passed to fellow scot alan mcgee by bobby gillespie on the strength of hearing the band sound check , mcgee signed them to his creation records label on a one-off deal , and mcgee also became the band 's manager their debut single , '' upside down '' , was recorded in october and released in november that year the band were gaining increasing attention from the music press at this time with neil taylor of the nme describing them as '' the best band in the world '' playing in front of small audiences , during early shows the mary chain performed very short gigs , typically fuelled by amphetamines and lasting around 20 minutes , and played with their backs to the audience , refusing to speak to them the label had initially refused to press the single due to its b-side , '' suck '' , but went ahead given the alternative put forward by the band , a song called '' jesus fuck '' the follow-up , '' you trip me up '' , was delayed due to staff at the pressing plant refusing to press it due to the presence of the song , now re-titled '' jesus suck '' ; the single was released in june 1985 with a new b-side , '' just out of reach '' john peel got the band to record a second session for his bbc radio 1 show in february 1985 ( the first was only a few months earlier ) , and the band also made a tv appearance on whistle test in march and the tube the same year in a performance on belgian television in march 1985 , the band did smash the set and the audio equipment , but this was at the request of the tv producer support band meat whiplash had stirred up violence before the mary chain set foot onto the stage when singer paul mcdermott threw an empty wine bottle into the audience , prompting four members of the crowd to attack him , leading to their set being abandoned the venue blamed the band 's late appearance and two equipment breakdowns , while mcgee issued a statement saying that '' the audience were not smashing up the hall , they were smashing up pop music '' , going on to say '' this is truly art as terrorism '' a major factor in the audience reaction was the length of the band 's sets at the time , which lasted less than twenty-five minutes , jim explaining this with '' there 's never been a group good enough to play any longer '' on returning to the uk they toured the uk , this time without the trouble that had marred earlier performances a second version of '' some candy talking '' was issued on a free ep issued with the nme in january 1986 , and the song was released as the band 's next single in july it reached number thirteen in the uk singles chart , but attracted controversy when bbc radio 1 dj mike smith decided that the song was a paean to illegal drugs ( denied by the band at the time , but admitted by william a year later ) and convinced the station to ban it from being played john moore had become an established member , but moved to rhythm guitar , with former redskins member martin hewes joining the band briefly ( although he strongly denies ever joining ) and former dead can dance percussionist james pinker taking over on drums blanco y negro manager geoff travis took over management duties , and the band returned in december with two gigs at the national ballroom in kilburn , where they premiered new songs including '' april skies '' and '' hit '' the various formats released also included a cover of bo diddley 's '' who do you love ?

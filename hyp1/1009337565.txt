the idea that regulation of interstate commerce may to some extent be an exclusive federal power was discussed even before adoption of the constitution on september 15 , 1787 , the framers of the constitution debated in philadelphia whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of tonnage without congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of harbors and the building of lighthouses james madison believed that the mere existence of the commerce clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage : '' madison was more and more convinced that the regulation of commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority '' roger sherman disagreed : '' the power of the united states to regulate trade being supreme can control interferences of the state regulations when such interferences happen ; so that there is no danger to be apprehended from a concurrent jurisdiction '' sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power , the latter being one of the concurrent powers shared by the federal and state governments ultimately , the philadelphia convention decided upon the present language about duties of tonnage in article i , section 10 , which says : '' no state shall , without the consent of congress , lay any duty of tonnage ogden , marshall wrote that the power to regulate interstate commerce '' can never be exercised by the people themselves , but must be placed in the hands of agents , or lie dormant '' in concurrence , justice william johnson was even more emphatic that the constitution is '' altogether in favor of the exclusive grants to congress of power over commerce black-bird creek marsh co , marshall wrote : '' we do not think that the state act empowering the black bird creek marsh company to place a dam across the creek , can , under all the circumstances of the case , be considered as repugnant to the power to regulate commerce in its dormant state , or as being in conflict with any law passed on the subject if marshall was suggesting that the power over interstate commerce is an exclusive federal power , the dormant commerce clause doctrine eventually developed very differently : it treats regulation that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce as a concurrent power , rather than an exclusive federal power , and it treats regulation that does so as an exclusive federal power thus , the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but '' not absolutely exclusive ''

rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism , laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the constitution was designed to prevent hamilton ) ; madison , vices of the political system of the united states , in 2 writings of james madison 362 & ndash ; 363 ( g in order to determine whether a law violates a so-called '' dormant '' aspect of the commerce clause , the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce thus , in a dormant commerce clause case , a court is initially concerned with whether the law facially discriminates against out-of-state actors or has the effect of favoring in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests discriminatory laws motivated by '' simple economic protectionism '' are subject to a '' virtually per se rule of invalidity '' , city of philadelphia v new jersey 437 u.s on the other hand , when a law is '' directed to legitimate local concerns , with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental '' , that is , where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade , the court has adopted a much more flexible approach , the general contours of which were outlined in pike v if the law is not outright or intentionally discriminatory or protectionist , but still has some impact on interstate commerce , the court will evaluate the law using a balancing test in pike , the court explained that a state regulation having only '' incidental '' effects on interstate commerce '' will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits '' when weighing burdens against benefits , a court should consider both '' the nature of the local interest involved , and whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities '' thus regulation designed to implement public health and safety , or serve other legitimate state interests , but impact interstate commerce as an incident to that purpose , are subject to a test akin to the rational basis test , a minimum level of scrutiny if discrimination is established , the burden shifts to the state or local government to show that the local benefits of the statute outweigh its discriminatory effects , and that the state or municipality lacked a nondiscriminatory alternative that could have adequately protected the relevant local interests if the challenging party can not show that the statute is discriminatory , then it must demonstrate that the statute places a burden on interstate commerce that '' is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits north dakota , 504 u.s the court addressed maryland 's unusual practice of taxing personal income earned in maryland , and taxing personal income of its citizens earned outside maryland , without any tax credit for income tax paid to other states the court held this sort of double-taxation to be a violation of the dormant commerce clause the court faulted justice antonin scalia 's criticism of the dormant commerce clause doctrine by saying that he failed to '' explain why , under his interpretation of the constitution , the import-export clause would not lead to the same result that we reach under the dormant commerce clause '' the history is described in oklahoma tax commission v 175 ( 1995 ) : the command has been stated more easily than its object has been attained , however , and the court 's understanding of the dormant commerce clause has taken some turns in its early stages , the court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly immune from state taxation '' in any form '' , '' even though the same amount of tax should be laid on ( intrastate ) commerce '' 250 , which examined new mexico 's franchise tax , measured by gross receipts , as applied to receipts from out-of-state advertisers in a journal produced by taxpayers in new mexico but circulated both inside and outside the state the court explained that '' it was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business '' during the transition period , some taxes were upheld based on a careful review of the actual economic impact of the tax , and other taxes were reviewed based on the kind of tax involved , whether the tax had a nefarious impact on commerce or not under this formalistic approach , a tax might be struck down , and then re-passed with exactly the same economic incidence , but under another name , and then withstand review the absurdity of this approach was made manifest in the two railway express cases there was no real economic difference between the statutes in railway express i and railway express ii the court long since had recognized that interstate commerce may be made to pay its way the spector rule ( against privilege taxes ) had come to operate only as a rule of draftsmanship , and served only to distract the courts and parties from their inquiry into whether the challenged tax produced results forbidden by the commerce clause 274 ( 1977 ) , findlaw 's united states supreme court case and opinions which approved a mississippi privilege tax upon a michigan company engaged in the business of shipping automobiles to mississippi dealers this rule looks only to the fact that the incidence of the tax is the '' privilege of doing business '' ; it deems irrelevant any consideration of the practical effect of the tax complete auto transit must be recognized as the culmination of the court 's emerging commerce clause approach , not just in taxation , but in all of its aspects application of complete auto transit to state taxation remains a highly technical and specialized venture , requiring the application of commerce clause principles to an understanding of specialized tax law '' considering an equal protection clause challenge , the iowa supreme court held that the use of the federal government 's definitions of income were convenient for the state and was '' rationally related to the goal of administrative efficiency '' the supreme court rejected the notion that administrative convenience was a sufficient defense for subjecting foreign commerce to a higher tax burden than interstate commerce the supreme court held that '' a state 's preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the commerce clause even if the state 's own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination under the local processing requirement , a municipality seeks to force the local processing of raw materials before they are shipped in interstate commerce 1 ( 1928 ) ( striking down a louisiana statute that forbade shrimp to be exported unless the heads and hulls had first

decision to fund local infrastructure by guaranteeing a minimum volume of business for privately constructed landfills , incinerators , composters or other costly disposal sites if approval could be obtained , the bonds themselves would be counted against governmental credit limitations , or might impact the governmental body 's credit rating : in either instance the ability to bond for other purposes might be impaired but by guaranteeing customers for a privately constructed and financed facility , a private entity could issue its own bonds , privately , on the strength of the public 's waste assurance the private character of flow control regimens can thus be explained in part by the desire to utilize particular kinds of public financing devices it can also be explained by significant encouragement at the national level , in national legislation as well as in federal executive policy to achieve environmental objectives utilizing private resources '' the fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not , by itself establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce , '' the court wrote 456 ( 1981 ) the court upheld a state law that banned nonreturnable milk containers made of plastic but permitted other nonreturnable milk containers '' nothing in the purposes animating the commerce clause prohibits a state , in the absence of congressional action , from participating in the market and exercising the right to favor its own citizens over others the supreme court found that while the law was not infirm because of the dormant commerce clause , it violated the privileges and immunities clause of article iv of the constitution commerce clause twenty-first amendment to the united states constitution , for court

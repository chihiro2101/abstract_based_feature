the idea that regulation of interstate commerce may to some extent be an exclusive federal power was discussed even before adoption of the constitution james madison believed that the mere existence of the commerce clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage : '' madison was more and more convinced that the regulation of commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority '' roger sherman disagreed : '' the power of the united states to regulate trade being supreme can control interferences of the state regulations when such interferences happen ; so that there is no danger to be apprehended from a concurrent jurisdiction '' sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power , the latter being one of the concurrent powers shared by the federal and state governments ultimately , the philadelphia convention decided upon the present language about duties of tonnage in article i , section 10 , which says : '' no state shall , without the consent of congress , lay any duty of tonnage '' the word '' dormant '' , in connection with the commerce clause , originated in dicta of chief justice john marshall ogden , marshall wrote that the power to regulate interstate commerce '' can never be exercised by the people themselves , but must be placed in the hands of agents , or lie dormant black-bird creek marsh co , marshall wrote : '' we do not think that the state act empowering the black bird creek marsh company to place a dam across the creek , can , under all the circumstances of the case , be considered as repugnant to the power to regulate commerce in its dormant state , or as being in conflict with any law passed on the subject if marshall was suggesting that the power over interstate commerce is an exclusive federal power , the dormant commerce clause doctrine eventually developed very differently : it treats regulation that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce as a concurrent power , rather than an exclusive federal power , and it treats regulation that does so as an exclusive federal power thus , the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but '' not absolutely exclusive '' the approach began in the 1851 case of cooley v curtis wrote for the court : '' either absolutely to affirm , or deny that the nature of this commerce power requires exclusive legislation by congress , is to lose sight of the nature of the subjects of this power , and to assert concerning all of them , what is really applicable but to a part the first clear holding of the supreme court striking down a state law under the dormant commerce clause came in 1873 '' c & a carbone , inc hamilton ) ; madison , vices of the political system of the united states , in 2 writings of james madison 362 & ndash ; 363 ( g in order to determine whether a law violates a so-called '' dormant '' aspect of the commerce clause , the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce in this context , '' discrimination '' simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter new jersey 437 u.s see also brown-forman distillers v new york state liquor authority , on the other hand , when a law is '' directed to legitimate local concerns , with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental '' , that is , where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade , the court has adopted a much more flexible approach , the general contours of which were outlined in pike v whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities '' ) , 1995 ) , the court explained : if the state activity constitutes '' regulation '' of interstate commerce , then the court must proceed to a second inquiry : whether the activity regulates evenhandedly with only '' incidental '' effects on interstate commerce , or discriminates against interstate commerce if discrimination is established , the burden shifts to the state or local government to show that the local benefits of the statute outweigh its discriminatory effects , and that the state or municipality lacked a nondiscriminatory alternative that could have adequately protected the relevant local interests if the challenging party can not show that the statute is discriminatory , then it must demonstrate that the statute places a burden on interstate commerce that '' is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits 298 ( 1992 ) ; northwestern states portland cement co the court addressed maryland 's unusual practice of taxing personal income earned in maryland , and taxing personal income of its citizens earned outside maryland , without any tax credit for income tax paid to other states the court held this sort of double-taxation to be a violation of the dormant commerce clause the court faulted justice antonin scalia 's criticism of the dormant commerce clause doctrine by saying that he failed to '' explain why , under his interpretation of the constitution , the import-export clause would not lead to the same result that we reach under the dormant commerce clause '' as with the court 's application of the dormant commerce clause to discriminatory regulation , the pre-new deal court attempted to apply a formalistic approach to state taxation alleged to interfere with interstate commerce 175 ( 1995 ) : the command has been stated more easily than its object has been attained , however , and the court 's understanding of the dormant commerce clause has taken some turns the jefferson lines decision continues : in 1938 , the old formalism began to give way with justice stone 's opinion in western live stock v although the assessment could have been sustained solely on prior precedent , justice stone added a dash of the pragmatism that , with a brief interlude , has since become our aspiration in this quarter of the law the court explained that '' it was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business '' during the transition period , some taxes were upheld based on a careful review of the actual economic impact of the tax , and other taxes were reviewed based on the kind of tax involved , whether the tax had a nefarious impact on commerce or not under this formalistic approach , a tax might be struck down , and then re-passed with exactly the same economic incidence , but under another name , and then withstand review in the first , a tax imposed by the state of virginia on american business concerns operating within the state was struck down because it was a business privilege tax imposed on the privilege of doing business in interstate commerce the court long since had recognized that interstate commerce may be made to pay its way the death knell of formalism occurred in complete auto transit , inc v 274 ( 1977 ) , findlaw 's united states supreme court case and opinions the court there explained : appellant 's attack is based solely on decisions of this court holding that a tax on the '' privilege '' of engaging in an activity in the state may not be applied to an activity that is part of interstate commerce the rule reflects an underlying philosophy that interstate commerce should enjoy a sort of '' free trade '' immunity from state taxation complete auto transit is the last in a line of cases that gradually rejected a per se approach to state taxation challenges under the commerce clause 71 ( 1992 ) , the supreme court considered a case in which iowa taxed dividends from foreign subsidiaries , without allowing a credit for taxes paid to foreign governments , but not dividends from domestic subsidiaries operating outside iowa for federal income tax purposes , dividends from domestic subsidiaries are allowed to be exempted from the parent corporations income to avoid double taxation the supreme court held that '' a state 's preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the commerce clause even if the state 's own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination the basic idea of the local processing ordinance was to provide favored access to local processors of locally produced raw materials 313 , ( 1890 ) ( striking down a minnesota statute that required any meat sold within the state , whether originating within or without the state , to be examined by an inspector within the state ) ;

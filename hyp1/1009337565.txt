on september 15 , 1787 , the framers of the constitution debated in philadelphia whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of tonnage without congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of harbors and the building of lighthouses james madison believed that the mere existence of the commerce clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage : '' madison was more and more convinced that the regulation of commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority '' roger sherman disagreed : '' the power of the united states to regulate trade being supreme can control interferences of the state regulations when such interferences happen ; so that there is no danger to be apprehended from a concurrent jurisdiction '' sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power , the latter being one of the concurrent powers shared by the federal and state governments ultimately , the philadelphia convention decided upon the present language about duties of tonnage in article i , section 10 , which says : '' no state shall , without the consent of congress , lay any duty of tonnage '' the word '' dormant '' , in connection with the commerce clause , originated in dicta of chief justice john marshall ogden , marshall wrote that the power to regulate interstate commerce '' can never be exercised by the people themselves , but must be placed in the hands of agents , or lie dormant , marshall wrote : '' we do not think that the state act empowering the black bird creek marsh company to place a dam across the creek , can , under all the circumstances of the case , be considered as repugnant to the power to regulate commerce in its dormant state , or as being in conflict with any law passed on the subject thus , the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but '' not absolutely exclusive '' landscape : indians , indian tribes , and the constitution : indians , indian tribes , and the constitution , p board of wardens , 53 u.s the first clear holding of the supreme court striking down a state law under the dormant commerce clause came in 1873 hamilton ) ; madison , vices of the political system of the united states , in 2 writings of james madison 362 & ndash ; 363 ( g in order to determine whether a law violates a so-called '' dormant '' aspect of the commerce clause , the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce discriminatory laws motivated by '' simple economic protectionism '' are subject to a '' virtually per se rule of invalidity '' , city of philadelphia v see also brown-forman distillers v on the other hand , when a law is '' directed to legitimate local concerns , with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental '' , that is , where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade , the court has adopted a much more flexible approach , the general contours of which were outlined in pike v the court determines whether the interstate burden imposed by a law outweighs the local benefits bruce church , inc when weighing burdens against benefits , a court should consider both '' the nature of the local interest involved , and whether it could be promoted as well with a lesser impact on interstate activities '' ) , 1995 ) , the court explained : if the state activity constitutes '' regulation '' of interstate commerce , then the court must proceed to a second inquiry : whether the activity regulates evenhandedly with only '' incidental '' effects on interstate commerce , or discriminates against interstate commerce as we use the term here , '' discrimination '' simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter the party challenging the validity of a state statute or municipal ordinance bears the burden of showing that it discriminates against , or places some burden on , interstate commerce du mond , 336 u.s more recently , in the 2015 case of comptroller of the treasury of maryland v in its early stages , the court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly immune from state taxation '' in any form '' , '' even though the same amount of tax should be laid on ( intrastate ) commerce '' 250 , which examined new mexico 's franchise tax , measured by gross receipts , as applied to receipts from out-of-state advertisers in a journal produced by taxpayers in new mexico but circulated both inside and outside the state '' during the transition period , some taxes were upheld based on a careful review of the actual economic impact of the tax , and other taxes were reviewed based on the kind of tax involved , whether the tax had a nefarious impact on commerce or not under this formalistic approach , a tax might be struck down , and then re-passed with exactly the same economic incidence , but under another name , and then withstand review in the first , a tax imposed by the state of virginia on american business concerns operating within the state was struck down because it was a business privilege tax imposed on the privilege of doing business in interstate commerce the court upheld the reworded statute as not violative of the prohibition on privilege taxes , even though the impact of the old tax and new were essentially identical there was no real economic difference between the statutes in railway express i and railway express ii brady , 430 u.s 274 ( 1977 ) , findlaw 's united states supreme court case and opinions which approved a mississippi privilege tax upon a michigan company engaged in the business of shipping automobiles to mississippi dealers the court there explained : appellant 's attack is based solely on decisions of this court holding that a tax on the '' privilege '' of engaging in an activity in the state may not be applied to an activity that is part of interstate commerce this rule looks only to the fact that the incidence of the tax is the '' privilege of doing business '' ; it deems irrelevant any consideration of the practical effect of the tax these four factors , nexus , relationship to benefits , discrimination , and apportionment , have come to be regarded as the four complete auto transit factors applied repeatedly in subsequent cases application of complete auto transit to state taxation remains a highly technical and specialized venture , requiring the application of commerce clause principles to an understanding of specialized tax law for federal income tax purposes , dividends from domestic subsidiaries are allowed to be exempted from the parent corporations income to avoid double taxation the supreme court rejected the notion that administrative convenience was a sufficient defense for subjecting foreign commerce to a higher tax burden than interstate commerce the supreme court held that '' a state 's preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the commerce clause even if the state 's own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination but by guaranteeing customers for a privately constructed and financed facility , a private entity could issue its own bonds , privately , on the strength of the public 's waste assurance the private character of flow control regimens can thus be explained in part by the desire to utilize particular kinds of public financing devices it can also be explained by significant encouragement at the national level , in national legislation as well as in federal executive policy to achieve environmental objectives utilizing private resources ironically , these public-private efforts often took the form of local processing requirements which ultimately ran afoul of the commerce clause the town of clarkstown had decided that it wanted to promote waste assurance through a local private transfer station the ordinance had the following features : waste hauling in the town of clarkstown was accomplished by private haulers , subject to local regulation the scheme had the following aspects : ( a ) the town promoted the financing of a privately owned transfer station through a waste assurance agreement with the private company in short , it was as if the authors of the ordinance had gone to a treatise on the commerce clause and intentionally chosen a device which had been traditionally prohibited as the court in carbone wrote : we consider a so-called flow control ordinance , which requires all solid waste to be processed at a designated transfer station before leaving the municipality the avowed purpose of the ordinance is to retain the processing fees charged at the transfer station to amortize the cost of the facility because it attains this goal by depriving competitors , including out-of-state firms , of access to a local market , we hold that the flow control ordinance violates the commerce clause '' and , the court made it plain , that the problem with clarkstown 's ordinance was that it created a local processing requirement protective of a local private processing company : in this light , the flow control ordinance is just one more instance of local processing requirements that we long have held invalid the essential vice in laws of this sort is that they bar the import of the processing service out-of-state meat inspectors , or shrimp hullers , or milk pasteurizers , are deprived of access to local demand for their services . united haulers : local processing law benefiting public entity '' the fact that the burden of a state regulation falls on some interstate companies does not , by itself establish a claim of discrimination against interstate commerce , '' the court wrote there are two notable exceptions to the dormant commerce clause doctrine that can permit state laws or actions that otherwise violate the dormant commerce clause to survive court challenges the '' market participation exception '' to the dormant commerce clause does not give states unlimited authority to favor local interests , because limits from other laws and constitutional limits still apply if it was intended to forbid the states from making any regulations of commerce , it is difficult to account for the omission to prohibit it , when that prohibition has been so carefully and distinctly inserted in relation to other powers curtis wrote for the court that the commerce clause does not always require '' exclusive legislation by congress '' commerce clause twenty-first amendment to the united states constitution , for court rulings discussing possible commerce clause implications

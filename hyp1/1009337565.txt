the idea that regulation of interstate commerce may to some extent be an exclusive federal power was discussed even before adoption of the constitution on september 15 , 1787 , the framers of the constitution debated in philadelphia whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of tonnage without congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of harbors and the building of lighthouses farrand , records of the federal convention of 1787 , p james madison believed that the mere existence of the commerce clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage : '' madison was more and more convinced that the regulation of commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority '' roger sherman disagreed : '' the power of the united states to regulate trade being supreme can control interferences of the state regulations when such interferences happen ; so that there is no danger to be apprehended from a concurrent jurisdiction '' sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power , the latter being one of the concurrent powers shared by the federal and state governments ultimately , the philadelphia convention decided upon the present language about duties of tonnage in article i , section 10 , which says : '' no state shall , without the consent of congress , lay any duty of tonnage '' the word '' dormant '' , in connection with the commerce clause , originated in dicta of chief justice john marshall ogden , marshall wrote that the power to regulate interstate commerce '' can never be exercised by the people themselves , but must be placed in the hands of agents , or lie dormant '' in concurrence , justice william johnson was even more emphatic that the constitution is '' altogether in favor of the exclusive grants to congress of power over commerce if marshall was suggesting that the power over interstate commerce is an exclusive federal power , the dormant commerce clause doctrine eventually developed very differently : it treats regulation that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce as a concurrent power , rather than an exclusive federal power , and it treats regulation that does so as an exclusive federal power thus , the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but '' not absolutely exclusive '' landscape : indians , indian tribes , and the constitution : indians , indian tribes , and the constitution , p board of wardens , in which justice benjamin r curtis wrote for the court : '' either absolutely to affirm , or deny that the nature of this commerce power requires exclusive legislation by congress , is to lose sight of the nature of the subjects of this power , and to assert concerning all of them , what is really applicable but to a part the first clear holding of the supreme court striking down a state law under the dormant commerce clause came in 1873 justice anthony kennedy has written that : '' the central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism , laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the constitution was designed to prevent in order to determine whether a law violates a so-called '' dormant '' aspect of the commerce clause , the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce in this context , '' discrimination '' simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter thus , in a dormant commerce clause case , a court is initially concerned with whether the law facially discriminates against out-of-state actors or has the effect of favoring in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests which can only be overcome by a showing that the state has no other means to advance a legitimate local purpose new york state liquor authority , on the other hand , when a law is '' directed to legitimate local concerns , with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental '' , that is , where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade , the court has adopted a much more flexible approach , the general contours of which were outlined in pike v when weighing burdens against benefits , a court should consider both '' the nature of the local interest involved , and thus regulation designed to implement public health and safety , or serve other legitimate state interests , but impact interstate commerce as an incident to that purpose , are subject to a test akin to the rational basis test , a minimum level of scrutiny town of babylon , 66 f.3d 1272 , 1281 ( c.a.2 ( n.y ) , 1995 ) , the court explained : if the state activity constitutes '' regulation '' of interstate commerce , then the court must proceed to a second inquiry : whether the activity regulates evenhandedly with only '' incidental '' effects on interstate commerce , or discriminates against interstate commerce as we use the term here , '' discrimination '' simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter the party challenging the validity of a state statute or municipal ordinance bears the burden of showing that it discriminates against , or places some burden on , interstate commerce if the challenging party can not show that the statute is discriminatory , then it must demonstrate that the statute places a burden on interstate commerce that '' is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits clover leaf creamery co over the years , the supreme court has consistently held that the language of the commerce clause contains a further , negative command prohibiting certain state taxation even when congress has failed to legislate on the subject wynne , comptroller of treasury of md the court held this sort of double-taxation to be a violation of the dormant commerce clause the court faulted justice antonin scalia 's criticism of the dormant commerce clause doctrine by saying that he failed to '' explain why , under his interpretation of the constitution , the import-export clause would not lead to the same result that we reach under the dormant commerce clause '' application of the dormant commerce clause to state taxation is another manifestation of the court 's holdings that the commerce clause prevents a state from retreating into economic isolation or jeopardizing the welfare of the nation as a whole , as it would do if it were free to place burdens on the flow of commerce across its borders that commerce wholly within those borders would not bear '' wardair canada , inc as with the court 's application of the dormant commerce clause to discriminatory regulation , the pre-new deal court attempted to apply a formalistic approach to state taxation alleged to interfere with interstate commerce the history is described in oklahoma tax commission v in its early stages , the court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly immune from state taxation '' in any form '' , '' even though the same amount of tax should be laid on ( intrastate ) commerce '' accompanying the revolution in approach in the court 's congressional powers jurisprudence , the new deal court began to change its approach to state taxation as well 250 , which examined new mexico 's franchise tax , measured by gross receipts , as applied to receipts from out-of-state advertisers in a journal produced by taxpayers in new mexico but circulated both inside and outside the state although the assessment could have been sustained solely on prior precedent , justice stone added a dash of the pragmatism that , with a brief interlude , has since become our aspiration in this quarter of the law the court explained that '' it was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business but then , in the second , virginia revised the wording of its statute to impose a '' franchise tax '' on '' intangible property '' in the form of '' going concern '' value as measured by gross receipts the court long since had recognized that interstate commerce may be made to pay its way the death knell of formalism occurred in complete auto transit , inc v the court there explained : appellant 's attack is based solely on decisions of this court holding that a tax on the '' privilege '' of engaging in an activity in the state may not be applied to an activity that is part of interstate commerce this rule looks only to the fact that the incidence of the tax is the '' privilege of doing business '' ; it deems irrelevant any consideration of the practical effect of the tax the rule reflects an underlying philosophy that interstate commerce should enjoy a sort of '' free trade '' immunity from state taxation complete auto transit must be recognized as the culmination of the court 's emerging commerce clause approach , not just in taxation , but in all of its aspects application of complete auto transit to state taxation remains a highly technical and specialized venture , requiring the application of commerce clause principles to an understanding of specialized tax law japan lines , ltd this differential treatment arose from iowa 's adoption of the definition of '' net income '' used by the internal revenue service the iowa supreme court rejected a commerce clause claim because kraft failed to show '' that iowa businesses receive a commercial advantage over foreign commerce due to iowa 's taxing scheme '' considering an equal protection clause challenge , the iowa supreme court held that the use of the federal government 's definitions of income were convenient for the state and was '' rationally related to the goal of administrative efficiency '' in some locales , choice of the flow control device was driven by state bonding laws , or municipal finance concerns the ordinance had the following features : waste hauling in the town of clarkstown was accomplished by private haulers , subject to local regulation the scheme had the following aspects : ( a ) the town promoted the financing of a privately owned transfer station through a waste assurance agreement with the private company it is not the office of the commerce clause to control the decision of the voters on whether government or the private sector should provide waste management services on these occasions , the supreme court has '' struggled ( to put it nicely ) to develop a set of rules by which we may preserve a national market without needlessly intruding upon the states ' police powers , each exercise of which no doubt has some effect on the commerce of the nation there are two notable exceptions to the dormant commerce clause doctrine that can permit state laws or actions that otherwise violate the dormant commerce clause to survive court challenges a number of earlier supreme court justices also expressed dissatisfaction with the dormant commerce clause doctrine 1992 ) , the first circuit held that the dormant commerce clause

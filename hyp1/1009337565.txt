the idea that regulation of interstate commerce may to some extent be an exclusive federal power was discussed even before adoption of the constitution on september 15 , 1787 , the framers of the constitution debated in philadelphia whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of tonnage without congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of harbors and the building of lighthouses james madison believed that the mere existence of the commerce clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage : '' madison was more and more convinced that the regulation of commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority '' roger sherman disagreed : '' the power of the united states to regulate trade being supreme can control interferences of the state regulations when such interferences happen ; so that there is no danger to be apprehended from a concurrent jurisdiction '' sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power , the latter being one of the concurrent powers shared by the federal and state governments ultimately , the philadelphia convention decided upon the present language about duties of tonnage in article i , section 10 , which says : '' no state shall , without the consent of congress , lay any duty of tonnage '' the word '' dormant '' , in connection with the commerce clause , originated in dicta of chief justice john marshall for example , in the case of gibbons v ogden , marshall wrote that the power to regulate interstate commerce '' can never be exercised by the people themselves , but must be placed in the hands of agents , or lie dormant , marshall wrote : '' we do not think that the state act empowering the black bird creek marsh company to place a dam across the creek , can , under all the circumstances of the case , be considered as repugnant to the power to regulate commerce in its dormant state , or as being in conflict with any law passed on the subject thus , the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but '' not absolutely exclusive '' landscape : indians , indian tribes , and the constitution : indians , indian tribes , and the constitution , p board of wardens , in which justice benjamin r justice anthony kennedy has written that : '' the central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism , laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the constitution was designed to prevent in order to determine whether a law violates a so-called '' dormant '' aspect of the commerce clause , the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce in this context , '' discrimination '' simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter thus , in a dormant commerce clause case , a court is initially concerned with whether the law facially discriminates against out-of-state actors or has the effect of favoring in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests city of madison , wisconsin , 340 u.s washington state apple advertising comm taylor , 477 u.s on the other hand , when a law is '' directed to legitimate local concerns , with effects upon interstate commerce that are only incidental '' , that is , where other legislative objectives are credibly advanced and there is no patent discrimination against interstate trade , the court has adopted a much more flexible approach , the general contours of which were outlined in pike v if the law is not outright or intentionally discriminatory or protectionist , but still has some impact on interstate commerce , the court will evaluate the law using a balancing test the court determines whether the interstate burden imposed by a law outweighs the local benefits in pike , the court explained that a state regulation having only '' incidental '' effects on interstate commerce '' will be upheld unless the burden imposed on such commerce is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits '' when weighing burdens against benefits , a court should consider both '' the nature of the local interest involved , and thus regulation designed to implement public health and safety , or serve other legitimate state interests , but impact interstate commerce as an incident to that purpose , are subject to a test akin to the rational basis test , a minimum level of scrutiny ) , 1995 ) , the court explained : if the state activity constitutes '' regulation '' of interstate commerce , then the court must proceed to a second inquiry : whether the activity regulates evenhandedly with only '' incidental '' effects on interstate commerce , or discriminates against interstate commerce the party challenging the validity of a state statute or municipal ordinance bears the burden of showing that it discriminates against , or places some burden on , interstate commerce if the challenging party can not show that the statute is discriminatory , then it must demonstrate that the statute places a burden on interstate commerce that '' is clearly excessive in relation to the putative local benefits at 142 , 90 s.ct wynne , 575 u.s the court addressed maryland 's unusual practice of taxing personal income earned in maryland , and taxing personal income of its citizens earned outside maryland , without any tax credit for income tax paid to other states the court faulted justice antonin scalia 's criticism of the dormant commerce clause doctrine by saying that he failed to '' explain why , under his interpretation of the constitution , the import-export clause would not lead to the same result that we reach under the dormant commerce clause '' in its early stages , the court held the view that interstate commerce was wholly immune from state taxation '' in any form '' , '' even though the same amount of tax should be laid on ( intrastate ) commerce '' 250 , which examined new mexico 's franchise tax , measured by gross receipts , as applied to receipts from out-of-state advertisers in a journal produced by taxpayers in new mexico but circulated both inside and outside the state although the assessment could have been sustained solely on prior precedent , justice stone added a dash of the pragmatism that , with a brief interlude , has since become our aspiration in this quarter of the law the court explained that '' it was not the purpose of the commerce clause to relieve those engaged in interstate commerce from their just share of state tax burden even though it increases the cost of doing the business under this formalistic approach , a tax might be struck down , and then re-passed with exactly the same economic incidence , but under another name , and then withstand review but then , in the second , virginia revised the wording of its statute to impose a '' franchise tax '' on '' intangible property '' in the form of '' going concern '' value as measured by gross receipts yet under the spector rule , the economic realities in railway express i became irrelevant 274 ( 1977 ) , findlaw 's united states supreme court case and opinions the rule reflects an underlying philosophy that interstate commerce should enjoy a sort of '' free trade '' immunity from state taxation application of complete auto transit to state taxation remains a highly technical and specialized venture , requiring the application of commerce clause principles to an understanding of specialized tax law the supreme court held that '' a state 's preference for domestic commerce over foreign commerce is inconsistent with the commerce clause even if the state 's own economy is not a direct beneficiary of the discrimination a line of important cases has dealt with local processing requirements under the local processing requirement , a municipality seeks to force the local processing of raw materials before they are shipped in interstate commerce the basic idea of the local processing ordinance was to provide favored access to local processors of locally produced raw materials they include minnesota v 313 , ( 1890 ) ( striking down a minnesota statute that required any meat sold within the state , whether originating within or without the state , to be examined by an inspector within the state ) ; foster-fountain packing co carbone : local processing law benefiting private entity some states and localities sought to promote private investment in these costly technologies by guaranteeing a longterm supply of customers one common theme was the decision to fund local infrastructure by guaranteeing a minimum volume of business for privately constructed landfills , incinerators , composters or other costly disposal sites if approval could be obtained , the bonds themselves would be counted against governmental credit limitations , or might impact the governmental body 's credit rating : in either instance the ability to bond for other purposes might be impaired the transfer station would process waste and then forward the waste to the disposal site designated by the town ( c ) the primary rationale for forcing in-state waste into the designated private transfer station was financial ; it was seen as a device to raise revenue to finance the transfer station the town of clarkstown 's ordinance was designed and written right in the teeth of the long line of supreme court cases which had historically struck down local processing requirements as the court in carbone wrote : we consider a so-called flow control ordinance , which requires all solid waste to be processed at a designated transfer station before leaving the municipality the court plainly regarded the decision as a relatively unremarkable decision , not a bold stroke unlike private enterprise , government is vested with the responsibility of protecting the health , safety , and welfare of its citizens the dormant commerce clause is not a roving license for federal courts to decide what activities are appropriate for state and local government to undertake , and what activities must be the province of private market competition 117 ( 1978 ) , where the state of maryland barred producers of petroleum products from operating retail service stations in the state the supreme court found that while the law was not infirm because of the dormant commerce clause , it violated the privileges and immunities clause of article iv of the constitution a number of earlier supreme court justices also expressed dissatisfaction with the dormant commerce clause doctrine commerce clause twenty-first amendment to the united

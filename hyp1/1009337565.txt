the idea that regulation of interstate commerce may to some extent be an exclusive federal power was discussed even before adoption of the constitution on september 15 , 1787 , the framers of the constitution debated in philadelphia whether to guarantee states the ability to lay duties of tonnage without congressional interference so that the states could finance the clearing of harbors and the building of lighthouses james madison believed that the mere existence of the commerce clause would bar states from imposing any duty of tonnage : '' madison was more and more convinced that the regulation of commerce was in its nature indivisible and ought to be wholly under one authority '' sherman saw the commerce power as similar to the tax power , the latter being one of the concurrent powers shared by the federal and state governments ultimately , the philadelphia convention decided upon the present language about duties of tonnage in article i , section 10 , which says : '' no state shall , without the consent of congress , lay any duty of tonnage '' the word '' dormant '' , in connection with the commerce clause , originated in dicta of chief justice john marshall ogden , marshall wrote that the power to regulate interstate commerce '' can never be exercised by the people themselves , but must be placed in the hands of agents , or lie dormant '' in concurrence , justice william johnson was even more emphatic that the constitution is '' altogether in favor of the exclusive grants to congress of power over commerce if marshall was suggesting that the power over interstate commerce is an exclusive federal power , the dormant commerce clause doctrine eventually developed very differently : it treats regulation that does not discriminate against or unduly burden interstate commerce as a concurrent power , rather than an exclusive federal power , and it treats regulation that does so as an exclusive federal power thus , the modern doctrine says that congressional power over interstate commerce is somewhat exclusive but '' not absolutely exclusive '' board of wardens , in which justice benjamin r the first clear holding of the supreme court striking down a state law under the dormant commerce clause came in 1873 pennsylvania , 82 u.s justice anthony kennedy has written that : '' the central rationale for the rule against discrimination is to prohibit state or municipal laws whose object is local economic protectionism , laws that would excite those jealousies and retaliatory measures the constitution was designed to prevent & nbsp ; 143 & ndash ; 145 ( c in order to determine whether a law violates a so-called '' dormant '' aspect of the commerce clause , the court first asks whether it discriminates on its face against interstate commerce in this context , '' discrimination '' simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter thus , in a dormant commerce clause case , a court is initially concerned with whether the law facially discriminates against out-of-state actors or has the effect of favoring in-state economic interests over out-of-state interests which can only be overcome by a showing that the state has no other means to advance a legitimate local purpose the court determines whether the interstate burden imposed by a law outweighs the local benefits thus regulation designed to implement public health and safety , or serve other legitimate state interests , but impact interstate commerce as an incident to that purpose , are subject to a test akin to the rational basis test , a minimum level of scrutiny ) , 1995 ) , the court explained : if the state activity constitutes '' regulation '' of interstate commerce , then the court must proceed to a second inquiry : whether the activity regulates evenhandedly with only '' incidental '' effects on interstate commerce , or discriminates against interstate commerce as we use the term here , '' discrimination '' simply means differential treatment of in-state and out-of-state economic interests that benefits the former and burdens the latter oklahoma , 441 u.s 298 ( 1992 ) ;

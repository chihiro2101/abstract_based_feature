jean léopold nicolas frédéric cuvier was born in montbéliard , where his protestant ancestors had lived since the time of the reformation his mother was anne clémence chatel ; his father , jean george cuvier , was a lieutenant in the swiss guards and a bourgeois of the town of montbéliard his mother , who was much younger than his father , tutored him diligently throughout his early years , so he easily surpassed the other children at school '' at the age of 10 , soon after entering the gymnasium , he encountered a copy of conrad gessner 's historiae animalium , the work that first sparked his interest in natural history he then began frequent visits to the home of a relative , where he could borrow volumes of the comte de buffon 's massive histoire naturelle all of these he read and reread , retaining so much of the information , that by the age of 12 , '' he was as familiar with quadrupeds and birds as a first-rate naturalist cuvier spent an additional four years at the caroline academy in stuttgart , where he excelled in all of his coursework cuvier regularly attended meetings held at the nearby town of valmont for the discussion of agricultural topics after hearing tessier speak on agricultural matters , cuvier recognized him as the author of certain articles on agriculture in the encyclopédie méthodique and addressed him as m arriving in the spring of 1795 , at the age of 26 , he soon became the assistant of jean-claude mertrud ( 1728–1802 ) , who had been appointed to the chair of animal anatomy at the jardin des plantes when mertrud died in 1802 , cuvier replaced him in office and the chair changed its name to chair of comparative anatomy thierry malvésy , georges cuvier : montbéliard 1769 - paris 1832 , friends of the natural history museum paris ( quarterly publication ) in this paper , he analyzed skeletal remains of indian and african elephants , as well as mammoth fossils , and a fossil skeleton known at that time as the 'ohio animal ' cuvier 's analysis established , for the first time , the fact that african and indian elephants were different species and that mammoths were not the same species as either african or indian elephants , so must be extinct years later , in 1806 , he would return to the 'ohio animal ' in another paper and give it the name , '' mastodon '' he concluded this skeleton represented yet another extinct animal and , by comparing its skull with living species of tree-dwelling sloths , that it was a kind of ground-dwelling giant sloth together , these two 1796 papers were a seminal or landmark event , becoming a turning point in the history of paleontology , and in the development of comparative anatomy , as well in 1799 , he succeeded daubenton as professor of natural history in the collège de france in 1802 , he became titular professor at the jardin des plantes ; and in the same year , he was appointed commissary of the institute to accompany the inspectors general of public instruction in this latter capacity , he visited the south of france , but in the early part of 1803 , he was chosen permanent secretary of the department of physical sciences of the academy , and he consequently abandoned the earlier appointment and returned to paris in 1812 he became a correspondent for the royal institute of the netherlands , and became member in 1827 cuvier then devoted himself more especially to three lines of inquiry : ( i ) the structure and classification of the mollusca ; ( ii ) the comparative anatomy and systematic arrangement of the fishes ; ( iii ) fossil mammals and reptiles and , secondarily , the osteology of living forms belonging to the same groups in 1812 , cuvier made what the cryptozoologist bernard heuvelmans called his '' rash dictum '' : he remarked that it was unlikely that any large animal remained undiscovered andrew dickson white , a history of the warfare of science with theology in christendom appleton ( 1922 ) vol.1 p.64 cuvier was by birth , education , and conviction a devout lutheran , and remained protestant throughout his life while regularly attending church services from 1822 until his death in 1832 , cuvier was grand master of the protestant faculties of theology of the french university he repeatedly emphasized that his extensive experience with fossil material indicated one fossil form does not , as a rule , gradually change into a succeeding , distinct fossil form a deep-rooted source of his opposition to the gradual transformation of species was his goal of creating an accurate taxonomy based on principles of comparative anatomy according to the university of california museum of paleontology , '' cuvier did not believe in organic evolution , for any change in an organism 's anatomy would have rendered it unable to survive he studied the mummified cats and ibises that geoffroy had brought back from napoleon 's invasion of egypt , and showed they were no different from their living counterparts ; cuvier used this to support his claim that life forms did not evolve over time '' he also observed that napoleon 's expedition to egypt had retrieved animals mummified thousands of years previously that seemed no different from their modern counterparts since a lesser time produced no organic changes , neither , he argued , would a much longer time many writers have unjustly accused cuvier of obstinately maintaining that fossil human beings could never be found ; english translation quoted from he was not dogmatic in this claim , however ; when new evidence came to light , he included in a later edition an appendix describing a skeleton that he freely admitted was an '' instance of a fossil human petrifaction '' the harshness of his criticism and the strength of his reputation , however , continued to discourage naturalists from speculating about the gradual transmutation of species , until charles darwin published on the origin of species more than two decades after cuvier 's death early in his tenure at the national museum in paris , cuvier published studies of fossil bones in which he argued that they belonged to large , extinct quadrupeds his first two such publications were those identifying mammoth and mastodon fossils as belonging to extinct species rather than modern elephants and the study in which he identified the megatherium as a giant , extinct species of sloth at the time cuvier presented his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants , it was still widely believed that no species of animal had ever become extinct the idea that these bones belonged to elephants living - but hiding - somewhere on earth seemed ridiculous to cuvier because it would be nearly impossible to miss them due to their enormous size unlike cuvier , they did n't believe that extinction was a sudden process ; they believed that like the earth , animals collectively undergo gradual change as a species this differed widely from cuvier 's theory , which seemed to propose that animal extinction was catastrophic cuvier 's early work demonstrated conclusively that extinction was indeed a credible natural global process influence on cuvier 's theory of extinction was his collection of specimens from the new world , many of them obtained from native americans he was impressed that most of the native american accounts identified the enormous bones , teeth , and tusks as animals of the deep past that had been destroyed by catastrophe in fact , he believed that earth 's existence was limited and not as extended as many natural scientists , like lamarck , believed it to be cuvier did n't wish to delve much into the causation of all the extinction and introduction of new animal species but rather focused on the sequential aspects of animal history on earth cuvier collaborated for several years with alexandre brongniart , an instructor at the paris mining school , to produce a monograph on the geology of the region around paris in 1808 cuvier identified a fossil found in maastricht as a giant marine lizard , the first known mosasaur cuvier 's researches on fish , begun in 1801 , finally culminated in the publication of the histoire naturelle des poissons , which contained descriptions of 5,000 species of fishes , and was a joint production with achille valenciennes cuvier 's work on this project extended over the years 1828–1831 cuvier is commemorated in the naming of several animals ; they include cuvier 's beaked whale ( which he first thought to be extinct ) , cuvier 's gazelle , cuvier 's toucan , cuvier 's bichir , cuvier 's dwarf caiman , and galeocerdo cuvier ( tiger shark ) discours sur les révolutions de la surface du globe et sur les changements qu'elles ont produits dans le règne animal ( 1822 )

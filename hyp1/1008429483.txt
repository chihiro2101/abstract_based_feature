his mother was anne clémence chatel ; his father , jean george cuvier , was a lieutenant in the swiss guards and a bourgeois of the town of montbéliard his mother , who was much younger than his father , tutored him diligently throughout his early years , so he easily surpassed the other children at school during his gymnasium years , he had little trouble acquiring latin and greek , and was always at the head of his class in mathematics , history , and geography according to lee , '' the history of mankind was , from the earliest period of his life , a subject of the most indefatigable application ; and long lists of sovereigns , princes , and the driest chronological facts , once arranged in his memory , were never forgotten he then began frequent visits to the home of a relative , where he could borrow volumes of the comte de buffon 's massive histoire naturelle so in july 1788 , he took a job at fiquainville chateau in normandy as tutor to the only son of the comte d'héricy , a protestant noble cuvier regularly attended meetings held at the nearby town of valmont for the discussion of agricultural topics tessier replied in dismay , '' i am known , then , and consequently lost as a result , cuvier entered into correspondence with several leading naturalists of the day , and was invited to paris arriving in the spring of 1795 , at the age of 26 , he soon became the assistant of jean-claude mertrud ( 1728–1802 ) , who had been appointed to the chair of animal anatomy at the jardin des plantes when mertrud died in 1802 , cuvier replaced him in office and the chair changed its name to chair of comparative anatomy thierry malvésy , georges cuvier : montbéliard 1769 - paris 1832 , friends of the natural history museum paris ( quarterly publication ) on 4 april 1796 he began to lecture at the école centrale du pantheon and , at the opening of the national institute in april , he read his first paleontological paper , which subsequently was published in 1800 under the title mémoires sur les espèces d'éléphants vivants et fossiles in this paper , he analyzed skeletal remains of indian and african elephants , as well as mammoth fossils , and a fossil skeleton known at that time as the 'ohio animal ' cuvier 's analysis established , for the first time , the fact that african and indian elephants were different species and that mammoths were not the same species as either african or indian elephants , so must be extinct years later , in 1806 , he would return to the 'ohio animal ' in another paper and give it the name , '' mastodon '' he concluded this skeleton represented yet another extinct animal and , by comparing its skull with living species of tree-dwelling sloths , that it was a kind of ground-dwelling giant sloth together , these two 1796 papers were a seminal or landmark event , becoming a turning point in the history of paleontology , and in the development of comparative anatomy , as well in this latter capacity , he visited the south of france , but in the early part of 1803 , he was chosen permanent secretary of the department of physical sciences of the academy , and he consequently abandoned the earlier appointment and returned to paris cuvier was elected a foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1822 cuvier then devoted himself more especially to three lines of inquiry : ( i ) the structure and classification of the mollusca ; ( ii ) the comparative anatomy and systematic arrangement of the fishes ; ( iii ) fossil mammals and reptiles and , secondarily , the osteology of living forms belonging to the same groups in 1812 , cuvier made what the cryptozoologist bernard heuvelmans called his '' rash dictum '' : he remarked that it was unlikely that any large animal remained undiscovered according to the university of california museum of paleontology , '' cuvier did not believe in organic evolution , for any change in an organism 's anatomy would have rendered it unable to survive cuvier , however , in turn criticized how lamarck and other naturalists conveniently introduced hundreds of thousands of years '' with a stroke of a pen '' to uphold their theory instead , he argued that one may judge what a long time would produce only by multiplying what a lesser time produces since a lesser time produced no organic changes , neither , he argued , would a much longer time cuvier attempted to explain this paleontological phenomenon he envisioned ( which would be readdressed more than a century later by '' punctuated equilibrium '' ) and to harmonize it with the bible the lack of change was consistent with the supposed sacred immutability of '' species '' , but , again , the idea of extinction , of which cuvier was the great proponent , obviously was not petrified bones , which have had time to mineralize and turn to stone , are typically far older than bones found to that date '' however , cuvier 's actual method was heavily dependent on the comparison of fossil specimens with the anatomy of extant species in the necessary context of his vast knowledge of animal anatomy and access to unparallelled natural history collections in paris this reality , however , did not prevent the rise of a popular legend that cuvier could reconstruct the entire bodily structures of extinct animals given only a few fragments of bone at the time cuvier presented his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants , it was still widely believed that no species of animal had ever become extinct authorities such as buffon had claimed that fossils found in europe of animals such as the woolly rhinoceros and the mammoth were remains of animals still living in the tropics ( i.e this discovery led cuvier to denounce the idea that fossils came from those that are currently living the idea that these bones belonged to elephants living - but hiding - somewhere on earth seemed ridiculous to cuvier because it would be nearly impossible to miss them due to their enormous size cuvier 's theory on extinction has met opposition from other notable natural scientists like darwin and charles lyell unlike cuvier , they did n't believe that extinction was a sudden process ; they believed that like the earth , animals collectively undergo gradual change as a species at this time , new species rose and others fell , precipitating the arrival of human beings cuvier came to believe that most , if not all , the animal fossils he examined were remains of species that had become extinct instead , he proposed that humans were around long enough to indirectly maintain the fossilized records of ancient earth though he found many accounts of the water catastrophe unclear , he did believe that such an event occurred at the brink of human history nonetheless this led cuvier to become an active proponent of the geological school of thought called catastrophism , which maintained that many of the geological features of the earth and the history of life could be explained by catastrophic events that had caused the extinction of many species of animals cuvier 's own explanation for such a catastrophic event is derived from two different sources , including those from jean-andré deluc and déodat de dolomieu he strongly suggested that the fossils he found were evidence of the world 's first reptiles , followed chronologically by mammals and humans cuvier did n't wish to delve much into the causation of all the extinction and introduction of new animal species but rather focused on the sequential aspects of animal history on earth in a way , his chronological dating of earth history somewhat reflected lamarck 's transformationist theories they published a preliminary version in 1808 and the final version was published in 1811 they concluded that the layers had been laid down over an extended period during which there clearly had been faunal succession and that the area had been submerged under sea water at times and at other times under fresh water cuvier was a protestant and a believer in monogenism , who held that all men descended from the biblical adam , although his position usually was confused as polygenist at the time that cuvier interacted with baartman , baartman 's '' existence was really quite miserable and extraordinarily poor ( '' cuvier '' , p

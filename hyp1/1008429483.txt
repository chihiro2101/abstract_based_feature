jean léopold nicolas frédéric cuvier was born in montbéliard , where his protestant ancestors had lived since the time of the reformation his mother was anne clémence chatel ; his father , jean george cuvier , was a lieutenant in the swiss guards and a bourgeois of the town of montbéliard his mother , who was much younger than his father , tutored him diligently throughout his early years , so he easily surpassed the other children at school during his gymnasium years , he had little trouble acquiring latin and greek , and was always at the head of his class in mathematics , history , and geography cuvier spent an additional four years at the caroline academy in stuttgart , where he excelled in all of his coursework there , during the early 1790s , he began his comparisons of fossils with extant forms cuvier regularly attended meetings held at the nearby town of valmont for the discussion of agricultural topics tessier replied in dismay , '' i am known , then , and consequently lost cuvier , '' no ; you are henceforth the object of our most anxious care as a result , cuvier entered into correspondence with several leading naturalists of the day , and was invited to paris thierry malvésy , georges cuvier : montbéliard 1769 - paris 1832 , friends of the natural history museum paris ( quarterly publication ) in this paper , he analyzed skeletal remains of indian and african elephants , as well as mammoth fossils , and a fossil skeleton known at that time as the 'ohio animal ' in his second paper in 1796 , he described and analyzed a large skeleton found in paraguay , which he would name megatherium he concluded this skeleton represented yet another extinct animal and , by comparing its skull with living species of tree-dwelling sloths , that it was a kind of ground-dwelling giant sloth they also greatly enhanced cuvier 's personal reputation and they essentially ended what had been a long-running debate about the reality of extinction in 1799 , he succeeded daubenton as professor of natural history in the collège de france in 1802 , he became titular professor at the jardin des plantes ; and in the same year , he was appointed commissary of the institute to accompany the inspectors general of public instruction in 1812 , cuvier made what the cryptozoologist bernard heuvelmans called his '' rash dictum '' : he remarked that it was unlikely that any large animal remained undiscovered he was eminent in all these capacities , and yet the dignity given by such high administrative positions was as nothing compared to his leadership in natural science he also was very active in founding the parisian bible society in 1818 , where he later served as a vice president from 1822 until his death in 1832 , cuvier was grand master of the protestant faculties of theology of the french university cuvier was critical of theories of evolution , in particular those proposed by his contemporaries lamarck and geoffroy saint-hilaire , which involved the gradual transmutation of one form into another he repeatedly emphasized that his extensive experience with fossil material indicated one fossil form does not , as a rule , gradually change into a succeeding , distinct fossil form such a project would become impossible if species were mutable , with no clear boundaries between them '' certainly '' , cuvier wrote , '' one can not detect any greater difference between these creatures and those we see , than between the human mummies and the skeletons of present-day men '' lamarck dismissed this conclusion , arguing that evolution happened much too slowly to be observed over just a few thousand years instead , he argued that one may judge what a long time would produce only by multiplying what a lesser time produces de lamarck ( praise for m cuvier attempted to explain this paleontological phenomenon he envisioned ( which would be readdressed more than a century later by '' punctuated equilibrium '' ) and to harmonize it with the bible he attributed the different time periods he was aware of as intervals between major catastrophes , the last of which is found in genesis the lack of change was consistent with the supposed sacred immutability of '' species '' , but , again , the idea of extinction , of which cuvier was the great proponent , obviously was not many writers have unjustly accused cuvier of obstinately maintaining that fossil human beings could never be found petrified bones , which have had time to mineralize and turn to stone , are typically far older than bones found to that date early in his tenure at the national museum in paris , cuvier published studies of fossil bones in which he argued that they belonged to large , extinct quadrupeds his primary evidence for his identifications of mammoths and mastodons as separate , extinct species was the structure of their jaws and teeth his primary evidence that the megatherium fossil had belonged to a massive sloth came from his comparison of its skull with those of extant sloth species at the time cuvier presented his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants , it was still widely believed that no species of animal had ever become extinct authorities such as buffon had claimed that fossils found in europe of animals such as the woolly rhinoceros and the mammoth were remains of animals still living in the tropics ( i.e this discovery led cuvier to denounce the idea that fossils came from those that are currently living cuvier 's theory on extinction has met opposition from other notable natural scientists like darwin and charles lyell this differed widely from cuvier 's theory , which seemed to propose that animal extinction was catastrophic at this time , new species rose and others fell , precipitating the arrival of human beings cuvier 's thinking on extinctions was influenced by his extensive readings in greek and latin literature ; he gathered every ancient report known in his day relating to discoveries of petrified bones of remarkable size in the mediterranean region influence on cuvier 's theory of extinction was his collection of specimens from the new world , many of them obtained from native americans he also maintained an archive of native american observations , legends , and interpretations of immense fossilized skeletal remains , sent to him by informants and friends in the americas he was impressed that most of the native american accounts identified the enormous bones , teeth , and tusks as animals of the deep past that had been destroyed by catastrophe cuvier came to believe that most , if not all , the animal fossils he examined were remains of species that had become extinct much of the evidence he used to support his catastrophist theories have been taken from his fossil records this principle 's ability to aid in reconstruction of fossils was also helpful to cuvier 's work in providing evidence in favor extinction ultimately , cuvier developed four embranchements , or branches , through which he classified animals based on his taxonomical and anatomical studies ( '' cuvier '' , p

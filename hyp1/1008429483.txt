jean léopold nicolas frédéric cuvier was born in montbéliard , where his protestant ancestors had lived since the time of the reformation his mother was anne clémence chatel ; his father , jean george cuvier , was a lieutenant in the swiss guards and a bourgeois of the town of montbéliard according to lee , '' the history of mankind was , from the earliest period of his life , a subject of the most indefatigable application ; and long lists of sovereigns , princes , and the driest chronological facts , once arranged in his memory , were never forgotten '' at the age of 10 , soon after entering the gymnasium , he encountered a copy of conrad gessner 's historiae animalium , the work that first sparked his interest in natural history he then began frequent visits to the home of a relative , where he could borrow volumes of the comte de buffon 's massive histoire naturelle all of these he read and reread , retaining so much of the information , that by the age of 12 , '' he was as familiar with quadrupeds and birds as a first-rate naturalist cuvier spent an additional four years at the caroline academy in stuttgart , where he excelled in all of his coursework cuvier regularly attended meetings held at the nearby town of valmont for the discussion of agricultural topics '' they soon became intimate and tessier introduced cuvier to his colleagues in paris— '' i have just found a pearl in the dunghill of normandy '' , he wrote his friend antoine-augustin parmentier when mertrud died in 1802 , cuvier replaced him in office and the chair changed its name to chair of comparative anatomy thierry malvésy , georges cuvier : montbéliard 1769 - paris 1832 , friends of the natural history museum paris ( quarterly publication ) cuvier 's analysis established , for the first time , the fact that african and indian elephants were different species and that mammoths were not the same species as either african or indian elephants , so must be extinct he further stated that the 'ohio animal ' represented a distinct and extinct species that was even more different from living elephants than mammoths were years later , in 1806 , he would return to the 'ohio animal ' in another paper and give it the name , '' mastodon '' in his second paper in 1796 , he described and analyzed a large skeleton found in paraguay , which he would name megatherium he concluded this skeleton represented yet another extinct animal and , by comparing its skull with living species of tree-dwelling sloths , that it was a kind of ground-dwelling giant sloth together , these two 1796 papers were a seminal or landmark event , becoming a turning point in the history of paleontology , and in the development of comparative anatomy , as well in 1799 , he succeeded daubenton as professor of natural history in the collège de france in 1802 , he became titular professor at the jardin des plantes ; and in the same year , he was appointed commissary of the institute to accompany the inspectors general of public instruction in this latter capacity , he visited the south of france , but in the early part of 1803 , he was chosen permanent secretary of the department of physical sciences of the academy , and he consequently abandoned the earlier appointment and returned to paris he was eminent in all these capacities , and yet the dignity given by such high administrative positions was as nothing compared to his leadership in natural science cuvier was critical of theories of evolution , in particular those proposed by his contemporaries lamarck and geoffroy saint-hilaire , which involved the gradual transmutation of one form into another a deep-rooted source of his opposition to the gradual transformation of species was his goal of creating an accurate taxonomy based on principles of comparative anatomy such a project would become impossible if species were mutable , with no clear boundaries between them he studied the mummified cats and ibises that geoffroy had brought back from napoleon 's invasion of egypt , and showed they were no different from their living counterparts ; cuvier used this to support his claim that life forms did not evolve over time '' lamarck dismissed this conclusion , arguing that evolution happened much too slowly to be observed over just a few thousand years cuvier , however , in turn criticized how lamarck and other naturalists conveniently introduced hundreds of thousands of years '' with a stroke of a pen '' to uphold their theory instead , he argued that one may judge what a long time would produce only by multiplying what a lesser time produces de lamarck ( praise for m de lamarck ) , cuvier wrote that lamarck 's theory of evolution instead , he said , the typical form makes an abrupt appearance in the fossil record , and persists unchanged to the time of its extinction the lack of change was consistent with the supposed sacred immutability of '' species '' , but , again , the idea of extinction , of which cuvier was the great proponent , obviously was not petrified bones , which have had time to mineralize and turn to stone , are typically far older than bones found to that date cuvier 's point was that all human bones found that he knew of , were of relatively recent age because they had not been petrified and had been found only in superficial strata the harshness of his criticism and the strength of his reputation , however , continued to discourage naturalists from speculating about the gradual transmutation of species , until charles darwin published on the origin of species more than two decades after cuvier 's death his first two such publications were those identifying mammoth and mastodon fossils as belonging to extinct species rather than modern elephants and the study in which he identified the megatherium as a giant , extinct species of sloth his primary evidence for his identifications of mammoths and mastodons as separate , extinct species was the structure of their jaws and teeth at the time cuvier presented his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants , it was still widely believed that no species of animal had ever become extinct the bones he studied , however , were remarkably different from the bones of elephants currently thriving in india and africa ultimately , his repeated identification of fossils as belonging to species unknown to man , combined with mineralogical evidence from his stratigraphical studies in paris , drove cuvier to the proposition that the abrupt changes the earth underwent over a long period of time caused some species to go extinct unlike cuvier , they did n't believe that extinction was a sudden process ; they believed that like the earth , animals collectively undergo gradual change as a species cuvier 's early work demonstrated conclusively that extinction was indeed a credible natural global process cuvier 's thinking on extinctions was influenced by his extensive readings in greek and latin literature ; he gathered every ancient report known in his day relating to discoveries of petrified bones of remarkable size in the mediterranean region influence on cuvier 's theory of extinction was his collection of specimens from the new world , many of them obtained from native americans he was impressed that most of the native american accounts identified the enormous bones , teeth , and tusks as animals of the deep past that had been destroyed by catastrophe cuvier came to believe that most , if not all , the animal fossils he examined were remains of species that had become extinct contrary to many natural scientists ' beliefs at the time , cuvier believed that animal extinction was not a product of anthropogenic causes this led cuvier to become an active proponent of the geological school of thought called catastrophism , which maintained that many of the geological features of the earth and the history of life could be explained by catastrophic events that had caused the extinction of many species of animals in a 1798 paper on the fossil remains of an animal found in some plaster quarries near paris , cuvier states what is known as the principle of the correlation of parts the principle of correlation of parts was also cuvier 's way of understanding function in a non-evolutionary context , without invoking a divine creator cuvier 's work on this project extended over the years 1828–1831 cuvier is commemorated in the naming of several animals ; they include cuvier 's beaked whale ( which he first thought to be extinct ) , cuvier 's gazelle , cuvier 's toucan , cuvier 's bichir , cuvier 's dwarf caiman , and galeocerdo cuvier ( tiger shark )

jean léopold nicolas frédéric cuvier was born in montbéliard , where his protestant ancestors had lived since the time of the reformation his mother was anne clémence chatel ; his father , jean george cuvier , was a lieutenant in the swiss guards and a bourgeois of the town of montbéliard '' at the age of 10 , soon after entering the gymnasium , he encountered a copy of conrad gessner 's historiae animalium , the work that first sparked his interest in natural history cuvier spent an additional four years at the caroline academy in stuttgart , where he excelled in all of his coursework although he knew no german on his arrival , after only nine months of study , he managed to win the school prize for that language cuvier 's german education exposed him to the work of the geologist abraham gottlob werner ( 1750 - 1817 ) , whose neptunism and emphasis on the importance of rigorous , direct observation of three-dimensional , structural relationships of rock formations to geological understanding provided models for cuvier 's scientific theories and methods cuvier regularly attended meetings held at the nearby town of valmont for the discussion of agricultural topics tessier replied in dismay , '' i am known , then , and consequently lost '' they soon became intimate and tessier introduced cuvier to his colleagues in paris— '' i have just found a pearl in the dunghill of normandy '' , he wrote his friend antoine-augustin parmentier as a result , cuvier entered into correspondence with several leading naturalists of the day , and was invited to paris arriving in the spring of 1795 , at the age of 26 , he soon became the assistant of jean-claude mertrud ( 1728–1802 ) , who had been appointed to the chair of animal anatomy at the jardin des plantes when mertrud died in 1802 , cuvier replaced him in office and the chair changed its name to chair of comparative anatomy thierry malvésy , georges cuvier : montbéliard 1769 - paris 1832 , friends of the natural history museum paris ( quarterly publication ) on 4 april 1796 he began to lecture at the école centrale du pantheon and , at the opening of the national institute in april , he read his first paleontological paper , which subsequently was published in 1800 under the title mémoires sur les espèces d'éléphants vivants et fossiles in this paper , he analyzed skeletal remains of indian and african elephants , as well as mammoth fossils , and a fossil skeleton known at that time as the 'ohio animal ' he further stated that the 'ohio animal ' represented a distinct and extinct species that was even more different from living elephants than mammoths were he concluded this skeleton represented yet another extinct animal and , by comparing its skull with living species of tree-dwelling sloths , that it was a kind of ground-dwelling giant sloth together , these two 1796 papers were a seminal or landmark event , becoming a turning point in the history of paleontology , and in the development of comparative anatomy , as well in 1802 , he became titular professor at the jardin des plantes ; and in the same year , he was appointed commissary of the institute to accompany the inspectors general of public instruction in this latter capacity , he visited the south of france , but in the early part of 1803 , he was chosen permanent secretary of the department of physical sciences of the academy , and he consequently abandoned the earlier appointment and returned to paris cuvier was elected a foreign honorary member of the american academy of arts and sciences in 1822 cuvier then devoted himself more especially to three lines of inquiry : ( i ) the structure and classification of the mollusca ; ( ii ) the comparative anatomy and systematic arrangement of the fishes ; ( iii ) fossil mammals and reptiles and , secondarily , the osteology of living forms belonging to the same groups during his lifetime , cuvier served as an imperial councilor under napoleon , president of the council of public instruction and chancellor of the university under the restored bourbons , grand officer of the legion of honour , a peer of france , minister of the interior , and president of the council of state under louis philippe a deep-rooted source of his opposition to the gradual transformation of species was his goal of creating an accurate taxonomy based on principles of comparative anatomy since a lesser time produced no organic changes , neither , he argued , would a much longer time moreover , his commitment to the principle of the correlation of parts caused him to doubt that any mechanism could ever gradually modify any part of an animal in isolation from all the other parts ( in the way lamarck proposed ) , without rendering the animal unable to survive de lamarck ) , cuvier wrote that lamarck 's theory of evolution instead , he said , the typical form makes an abrupt appearance in the fossil record , and persists unchanged to the time of its extinction the lack of change was consistent with the supposed sacred immutability of '' species '' , but , again , the idea of extinction , of which cuvier was the great proponent , obviously was not many writers have unjustly accused cuvier of obstinately maintaining that fossil human beings could never be found ; english translation quoted from he was not dogmatic in this claim , however ; when new evidence came to light , he included in a later edition an appendix describing a skeleton that he freely admitted was an '' instance of a fossil human petrifaction '' his primary evidence that the megatherium fossil had belonged to a massive sloth came from his comparison of its skull with those of extant sloth species '' however , cuvier 's actual method was heavily dependent on the comparison of fossil specimens with the anatomy of extant species in the necessary context of his vast knowledge of animal anatomy and access to unparallelled natural history collections in paris at the time cuvier presented his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants , it was still widely believed that no species of animal had ever become extinct authorities such as buffon had claimed that fossils found in europe of animals such as the woolly rhinoceros and the mammoth were remains of animals still living in the tropics ( i.e the bones he studied , however , were remarkably different from the bones of elephants currently thriving in india and africa this discovery led cuvier to denounce the idea that fossils came from those that are currently living ultimately , his repeated identification of fossils as belonging to species unknown to man , combined with mineralogical evidence from his stratigraphical studies in paris , drove cuvier to the proposition that the abrupt changes the earth underwent over a long period of time caused some species to go extinct unlike cuvier , they did n't believe that extinction was a sudden process ; they believed that like the earth , animals collectively undergo gradual change as a species cuvier 's early work demonstrated conclusively that extinction was indeed a credible natural global process influence on cuvier 's theory of extinction was his collection of specimens from the new world , many of them obtained from native americans cuvier came to believe that most , if not all , the animal fossils he examined were remains of species that had become extinct near the end of his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants , he said : : all of these facts , consistent among themselves , and not opposed by any report , seem to me to prove the existence of a world previous to ours , destroyed by some kind of catastrophe this led cuvier to become an active proponent of the geological school of thought called catastrophism , which maintained that many of the geological features of the earth and the history of life could be explained by catastrophic events that had caused the extinction of many species of animals cuvier did n't wish to delve much into the causation of all the extinction and introduction of new animal species but rather focused on the sequential aspects of animal history on earth cuvier also worked alongside alexandre brongniart in analyzing the parisian rock cycle from these findings , cuvier and brongniart concluded that many environmental changes occurred in quick catastrophes , though earth itself was often placid for extended periods of time in between sudden disturbances in 1826 , cuvier would publish a revised version under the name , discours sur les révolutions de la surface du globe ( discourse on the upheavals of the surface of the globe ) after cuvier 's death , the catastrophic school of geological thought lost ground to uniformitarianism , as championed by charles lyell and others , which claimed that the geological features of the earth were best explained by currently observable forces , such as erosion and volcanism , acting gradually over an extended period of time cuvier collaborated for several years with alexandre brongniart , an instructor at the paris mining school , to produce a monograph on the geology of the region around paris at the paris museum , cuvier furthered his studies on the anatomical classification of animals ( '' cuvier '' , p

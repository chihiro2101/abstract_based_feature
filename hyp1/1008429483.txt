jean léopold nicolas frédéric cuvier was born in montbéliard , where his protestant ancestors had lived since the time of the reformation his mother was anne clémence chatel ; his father , jean george cuvier , was a lieutenant in the swiss guards and a bourgeois of the town of montbéliard his mother , who was much younger than his father , tutored him diligently throughout his early years , so he easily surpassed the other children at school he then began frequent visits to the home of a relative , where he could borrow volumes of the comte de buffon 's massive histoire naturelle all of these he read and reread , retaining so much of the information , that by the age of 12 , '' he was as familiar with quadrupeds and birds as a first-rate naturalist cuvier spent an additional four years at the caroline academy in stuttgart , where he excelled in all of his coursework cuvier regularly attended meetings held at the nearby town of valmont for the discussion of agricultural topics there , he became acquainted with henri alexandre tessier ( 1741–1837 ) , who had assumed a false identity after hearing tessier speak on agricultural matters , cuvier recognized him as the author of certain articles on agriculture in the encyclopédie méthodique and addressed him as m '' they soon became intimate and tessier introduced cuvier to his colleagues in paris— '' i have just found a pearl in the dunghill of normandy '' , he wrote his friend antoine-augustin parmentier as a result , cuvier entered into correspondence with several leading naturalists of the day , and was invited to paris arriving in the spring of 1795 , at the age of 26 , he soon became the assistant of jean-claude mertrud ( 1728–1802 ) , who had been appointed to the chair of animal anatomy at the jardin des plantes when mertrud died in 1802 , cuvier replaced him in office and the chair changed its name to chair of comparative anatomy thierry malvésy , georges cuvier : montbéliard 1769 - paris 1832 , friends of the natural history museum paris ( quarterly publication ) cuvier 's analysis established , for the first time , the fact that african and indian elephants were different species and that mammoths were not the same species as either african or indian elephants , so must be extinct years later , in 1806 , he would return to the 'ohio animal ' in another paper and give it the name , '' mastodon '' together , these two 1796 papers were a seminal or landmark event , becoming a turning point in the history of paleontology , and in the development of comparative anatomy , as well from 1822 until his death in 1832 , cuvier was grand master of the protestant faculties of theology of the french university cuvier was critical of theories of evolution , in particular those proposed by his contemporaries lamarck and geoffroy saint-hilaire , which involved the gradual transmutation of one form into another he repeatedly emphasized that his extensive experience with fossil material indicated one fossil form does not , as a rule , gradually change into a succeeding , distinct fossil form such a project would become impossible if species were mutable , with no clear boundaries between them he studied the mummified cats and ibises that geoffroy had brought back from napoleon 's invasion of egypt , and showed they were no different from their living counterparts ; cuvier used this to support his claim that life forms did not evolve over time '' lamarck dismissed this conclusion , arguing that evolution happened much too slowly to be observed over just a few thousand years instead , he argued that one may judge what a long time would produce only by multiplying what a lesser time produces moreover , his commitment to the principle of the correlation of parts caused him to doubt that any mechanism could ever gradually modify any part of an animal in isolation from all the other parts ( in the way lamarck proposed ) , without rendering the animal unable to survive his first two such publications were those identifying mammoth and mastodon fossils as belonging to extinct species rather than modern elephants and the study in which he identified the megatherium as a giant , extinct species of sloth his primary evidence that the megatherium fossil had belonged to a massive sloth came from his comparison of its skull with those of extant sloth species this reality , however , did not prevent the rise of a popular legend that cuvier could reconstruct the entire bodily structures of extinct animals given only a few fragments of bone authorities such as buffon had claimed that fossils found in europe of animals such as the woolly rhinoceros and the mammoth were remains of animals still living in the tropics ( i.e thereafter , cuvier performed a pioneering research study on some elephant fossils excavated around paris the bones he studied , however , were remarkably different from the bones of elephants currently thriving in india and africa ultimately , his repeated identification of fossils as belonging to species unknown to man , combined with mineralogical evidence from his stratigraphical studies in paris , drove cuvier to the proposition that the abrupt changes the earth underwent over a long period of time caused some species to go extinct cuvier 's theory on extinction has met opposition from other notable natural scientists like darwin and charles lyell unlike cuvier , they did n't believe that extinction was a sudden process ; they believed that like the earth , animals collectively undergo gradual change as a species influence on cuvier 's theory of extinction was his collection of specimens from the new world , many of them obtained from native americans he was impressed that most of the native american accounts identified the enormous bones , teeth , and tusks as animals of the deep past that had been destroyed by catastrophe cuvier came to believe that most , if not all , the animal fossils he examined were remains of species that had become extinct near the end of his 1796 paper on living and fossil elephants , he said : : all of these facts , consistent among themselves , and not opposed by any report , seem to me to prove the existence of a world previous to ours , destroyed by some kind of catastrophe contrary to many natural scientists ' beliefs at the time , cuvier believed that animal extinction was not a product of anthropogenic causes though he found many accounts of the water catastrophe unclear , he did believe that such an event occurred at the brink of human history nonetheless cuvier did n't wish to delve much into the causation of all the extinction and introduction of new animal species but rather focused on the sequential aspects of animal history on earth cuvier also worked alongside alexandre brongniart in analyzing the parisian rock cycle in 1826 , cuvier would publish a revised version under the name , discours sur les révolutions de la surface du globe ( discourse on the upheavals of the surface of the globe ) baron georges cuvier a discourse on the revolutions of the surface of the globe the increasing interest in the topic of mass extinction starting in the late twentieth century , however , has led to a resurgence of interest among historians of science and other scholars in this aspect of cuvier 's work however , despite cuvier 's exaggerations of the power of his principle , the basic concept is central to comparative anatomy and paleontology in this classic work , cuvier presented the results of his life 's research into the structure of living and fossil animals apart from his own original investigations in zoology and paleontology cuvier carried out a vast amount of work as perpetual secretary of the national institute , and as an official connected with public education generally ; and much of this work appeared ultimately in a published form cuvier is commemorated in the naming of several animals ; they include cuvier 's beaked whale ( which he first thought to be extinct ) , cuvier 's gazelle , cuvier 's toucan , cuvier 's bichir , cuvier 's dwarf caiman , and galeocerdo cuvier ( tiger shark ) ( '' cuvier '' , p cuvier ( 3 volumes , 1819–1827 ) vol

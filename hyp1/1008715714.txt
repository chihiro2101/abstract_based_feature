many different names in different parts of the world are used for the crop lentil the genus lens is part of the subfamily faboideae which is contained in the flowering plant family fabaceae or commonly known as legume or bean family , of the order fabales in the kingdom plantae among the different taxa of wild lentils , l therefore , the genus lens comprises seven taxa in six species : lens culinaris subsp orientalis ) lens odemensis lens ervoides lens nigricans lens lamottei lens tomentosus lentil is hypogeal , which means the cotyledons of the germinating seed stay in the ground and inside the seed coat the plant is a diploid , annual , bushy herb of erect , semierect , or spreading and compact growth and normally varies from in height the leaves are alternate , of oblong-linear and obtuse shape and from yellowish green to dark bluish green in colour the flowers , one to four in number , are small , white , pink , purple , pale purple , or pale blue in colour normally , each of them contains two seeds , about in diameter , in the characteristic lens shape the several cultivated varieties of lentil differ in size , hairiness , and colour of the leaves , flowers , and seeds at the end of the second day and on the third day after the opening of the flowers , they close completely and the colour begins to fade shelled lentils show the colour of the cotyledon which can be yellow , orange , red , or green a combination of gravity , screens and air flow is used to clean and sort lentils based on shape and density a major part of the world 's red lentil production undergoes a secondary processing step the seeds require a cooking time of 10 to 40 minutes , depending on the variety ; small varieties with the husk removed , such as the common red lentil , require shorter cooking times lentils are also used in many regional varieties of sweets in western countries , cooked lentils are often used in salads lentils have the second-highest ratio of protein to food energy of any legume , after soybeans lentils also have antinutrient factors , such as trypsin inhibitors and a relatively high phytate content wild lens species are a significant source of genetic variation for improving the relatively narrow genetic base of this crop according to their inter-crossability lens species can be divided into three gene pools : primary gene pool : l

many different names in different parts of the world are used for the crop lentil the first use of the word lens to designate a specific genus was in the 16th century by the botanist tournefort lens is a small genus which consists of the cultivated l among the different taxa of wild lentils , l therefore , the genus lens comprises seven taxa in six species : lens culinaris subsp the leaves are alternate , of oblong-linear and obtuse shape and from yellowish green to dark bluish green in colour normally , each of them contains two seeds , about in diameter , in the characteristic lens shape the several cultivated varieties of lentil differ in size , hairiness , and colour of the leaves , flowers , and seeds after three to four days , the setting of the pods takes place a major part of the world 's red lentil production undergoes a secondary processing step these lentils are husk , split and polished in the indian subcontinent , this process is called dhal milling the moisture content of the lentils prior dehulling is crucial to guarantee a good dehulling efficiency the hull of lentils usually accounts for 6 to 7 percent of the total seed weight , which is lower than most legumes the seeds require a cooking time of 10 to 40 minutes , depending on the variety ; small varieties with the husk removed , such as the common red lentil , require shorter cooking times boiled lentils and lentil stock are used to thicken most vegetarian curries lentils are also used in many regional varieties of sweets in western countries , cooked lentils are often used in salads in italy , the traditional dish for new year 's eve is cotechino served with lentils additional resistant starch is synthesized from gelatinized starch , during cooling , after lentils are cooked wild lens species are a significant source of genetic variation for improving the relatively narrow genetic base of this crop

many different names in different parts of the world are used for the crop lentil lens is a small genus which consists of the cultivated l among the different taxa of wild lentils , l orientalis is considered to be the progenitor of the cultivated lentil and is now generally classified as l therefore , the genus lens comprises seven taxa in six species : lens culinaris subsp the leaves are alternate , of oblong-linear and obtuse shape and from yellowish green to dark bluish green in colour the flowers , one to four in number , are small , white , pink , purple , pale purple , or pale blue in colour they arise from the axils of the leaves , on a slender footstalk almost as long as the leaves normally , each of them contains two seeds , about in diameter , in the characteristic lens shape the seeds can also be mottled and speckled the several cultivated varieties of lentil differ in size , hairiness , and colour of the leaves , flowers , and seeds a combination of gravity , screens and air flow is used to clean and sort lentils based on shape and density the moisture content of the lentils prior dehulling is crucial to guarantee a good dehulling efficiency the hull of lentils usually accounts for 6 to 7 percent of the total seed weight , which is lower than most legumes lentils are used worldwide to cook many different dishes lentil flour is used to prepare several different bread varieties , such as papadum they are frequently combined with rice , which has a similar cooking time in western countries , cooked lentils are often used in salads raw lentils are 8 % water , 63 % carbohydrates including 11 % dietary fiber , 25 % protein , and 1 % fat ( table ) wild lens species are a significant source of genetic variation for improving the relatively narrow genetic base of this crop according to their inter-crossability lens species can be divided into three gene pools : primary gene pool : l

many different names in different parts of the world are used for the crop lentil the first use of the word lens to designate a specific genus was in the 16th century by the botanist tournefort lens is a small genus which consists of the cultivated l culinaris and six related wild taxa among the different taxa of wild lentils , l orientalis is considered to be the progenitor of the cultivated lentil and is now generally classified as l therefore , the genus lens comprises seven taxa in six species : lens culinaris subsp the leaves are alternate , of oblong-linear and obtuse shape and from yellowish green to dark bluish green in colour they arise from the axils of the leaves , on a slender footstalk almost as long as the leaves normally , each of them contains two seeds , about in diameter , in the characteristic lens shape at the end of the second day and on the third day after the opening of the flowers , they close completely and the colour begins to fade shelled lentils show the colour of the cotyledon which can be yellow , orange , red , or green a combination of gravity , screens and air flow is used to clean and sort lentils based on shape and density lentils are used worldwide to cook many different dishes in the indian subcontinent , lentil curry is part of the everyday diet , eaten with both rice and roti boiled lentils and lentil stock are used to thicken most vegetarian curries lentils are also used in many regional varieties of sweets in western countries , cooked lentils are often used in salads raw lentils are 8 % water , 63 % carbohydrates including 11 % dietary fiber , 25 % protein , and 1 % fat ( table ) although lentils have been an important crop for centuries , lentil breeding and genetic research have a relatively short history compared to that of many other crops wild lens species are a significant source of genetic variation for improving the relatively narrow genetic base of this crop

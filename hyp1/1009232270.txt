thumb the parabolic shape of a dish reflects the signal to the dish â€™ s focal point the lnb converts the signals from electromagnetic or radio waves to electrical signals and shifts the signals from the downlinked c-band and/or ku-band to the l band range direct broadcast satellite dishes use an lnbf , which integrates the feedhorn with the lnb a new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna , which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the university of waterloo in 2004 a typical value for a consumer type 60 & nbsp ; cm satellite dish at 11.75 & nbsp ; ghz is 37.50 & nbsp ; db at higher frequencies , mesh type designs are rarer though some designs have used a solid dish with perforations modern dishes intended for home television use are generally 43 & nbsp ; cm ( 18 & nbsp ; in ) to 80 & nbsp ; cm ( 31 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter , and are fixed in one position , for ku-band reception from one orbital position prior to the existence of direct broadcast satellite services , home users would generally have a motorised c-band dish of up to 3 m in diameter for reception of channels from different satellites thumb a satellite finder ( or sat finder ) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit with diseqc and usals , the satellite dish will automatically aim itself at one of sixteen satellites programmed in previously when pressing one of the channel buttons on the remote however , some designs much more effectively optimize simultaneous reception from multiple different satellite positions without re-positioning the dish motor-driven dishes assure better optimal focusing for the given dish size ; lnb is always in central alignment with the broadcasting satellite , but diseqc switches are faster than diseqc motors as no physical movement is required automatic tracking satellite dish satellitedish1.jpg general electric satellite dish for directv satellite television the first satellite television dishes were built to receive signals on the c-band analog , and were very large in december 1988 , luxembourg 's astra 1a satellite began transmitting analog television signals on the ku band for the european market this was the first widely used direct-broadcast satellite television system and allowed dishes as small as 20 & nbsp ; inches to be used

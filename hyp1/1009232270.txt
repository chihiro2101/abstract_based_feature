thumb the parabolic shape of a dish reflects the signal to the dish ’ s focal point direct broadcast satellite dishes use an lnbf , which integrates the feedhorn with the lnb a new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna , which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the university of waterloo in 2004 the theoretical gain ( antenna gain ) of a dish increases as the frequency increases a typical value for a consumer type 60 & nbsp ; cm satellite dish at 11.75 & nbsp ; ghz is 37.50 & nbsp ; db with lower frequencies , c-band for example , dish designers have a wider choice of materials prior to the existence of direct broadcast satellite services , home users would generally have a motorised c-band dish of up to 3 m in diameter for reception of channels from different satellites in the lnb they become down converted to 950–2150 & nbsp ; mhz , which is the frequency range allocated for the satellite service on the coaxial cable between lnbf and receiver thumb a satellite finder ( or sat finder ) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit professional satellite finder meters allow better dish alignment and provide received signal parameter values as well a dish that is mounted on a pole and driven by a stepper motor or a servo can be controlled and rotated to face any satellite position in the sky with diseqc and usals , the satellite dish will automatically aim itself at one of sixteen satellites programmed in previously when pressing one of the channel buttons on the remote automatic tracking satellite dish satellitedish1.jpg general electric satellite dish for directv satellite television parabolic antennas referred to as '' dish '' antennas had been in use long before satellite television the term satellite dish was coined in 1978 during the beginning of the satellite television industry , and came to refer to dish antennas that send and/or receive signals from communications satellites this was the first widely used direct-broadcast satellite television system and allowed dishes as small as 20 & nbsp ; inches to be used

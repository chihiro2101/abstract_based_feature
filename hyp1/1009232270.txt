direct broadcast satellite dishes use an lnbf , which integrates the feedhorn with the lnb a new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna , which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the university of waterloo in 2004 a typical value for a consumer type 60 & nbsp ; cm satellite dish at 11.75 & nbsp ; ghz is 37.50 & nbsp ; db the large size of dish required for lower frequencies led to the dishes being constructed from metal mesh on a metal framework modern dishes intended for home television use are generally 43 & nbsp ; cm ( 18 & nbsp ; in ) to 80 & nbsp ; cm ( 31 & nbsp ; in ) in diameter , and are fixed in one position , for ku-band reception from one orbital position prior to the existence of direct broadcast satellite services , home users would generally have a motorised c-band dish of up to 3 m in diameter for reception of channels from different satellites in the lnb they become down converted to 950â€“2150 & nbsp ; mhz , which is the frequency range allocated for the satellite service on the coaxial cable between lnbf and receiver only one of these frequency bands fits on the coaxial cable , so each of these bands needs a separate cable from the lnbf to a switching matrix or the receiver needs to select one of the 4 possibilities at a time the dc electric power for the lnb is provided through the same coaxial cable conductors that carry the signal to the receiver the receiver uses different power supply voltages ( 13 / 18 v ) to select vertical / horizontal antenna polarization , and an on/off pilot tone ( 22 & nbsp ; khz ) to instruct the lnb to select one of the two frequency bands thumb a satellite finder ( or sat finder ) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit right every standard-size dish enables simultaneous reception from multiple different satellite positions without re-positioning the dish , just by adding additional lnb or using special duo lnb , triple , or four feed monoblock lnb back of satellite dish.jpg the back side of an old c-band satellite dish showing the pole , mount , motor , and structure of the dish the term satellite dish was coined in 1978 during the beginning of the satellite television industry , and came to refer to dish antennas that send and/or receive signals from communications satellites the relatively strong k u band transmissions allowed the use of dishes as small as 90 & nbsp ; cm for the first time this was the first widely used direct-broadcast satellite television system and allowed dishes as small as 20 & nbsp ; inches to be used

thumb the parabolic shape of a dish reflects the signal to the dish â€™ s focal point the lnb converts the signals from electromagnetic or radio waves to electrical signals and shifts the signals from the downlinked c-band and/or ku-band to the l band range direct broadcast satellite dishes use an lnbf , which integrates the feedhorn with the lnb a new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna , which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the university of waterloo in 2004 a typical value for a consumer type 60 & nbsp ; cm satellite dish at 11.75 & nbsp ; ghz is 37.50 & nbsp ; db the large size of dish required for lower frequencies led to the dishes being constructed from metal mesh on a metal framework a common misconception is that the lnbf ( low-noise block/feedhorn ) , the device at the front of the dish , receives the signal directly from the atmosphere prior to the existence of direct broadcast satellite services , home users would generally have a motorised c-band dish of up to 3 m in diameter for reception of channels from different satellites in a single receiver residential installation there is a single coaxial cable running from the receiver set-top box in the building to the lnb on the dish thumb a satellite finder ( or sat finder ) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit professional satellite finder meters allow better dish alignment and provide received signal parameter values as well however , some designs much more effectively optimize simultaneous reception from multiple different satellite positions without re-positioning the dish back of satellite dish.jpg the back side of an old c-band satellite dish showing the pole , mount , motor , and structure of the dish the term satellite dish was coined in 1978 during the beginning of the satellite television industry , and came to refer to dish antennas that send and/or receive signals from communications satellites the first satellite television dishes were built to receive signals on the c-band analog , and were very large this great decrease of dish size also allowed satellite dishes to be installed on vehicles

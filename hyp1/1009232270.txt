thumb the parabolic shape of a dish reflects the signal to the dish ’ s focal point the lnb converts the signals from electromagnetic or radio waves to electrical signals and shifts the signals from the downlinked c-band and/or ku-band to the l band range direct broadcast satellite dishes use an lnbf , which integrates the feedhorn with the lnb a new form of omnidirectional satellite antenna , which does not use a directed parabolic dish and can be used on a mobile platform such as a vehicle was announced by the university of waterloo in 2004 the theoretical gain ( antenna gain ) of a dish increases as the frequency increases a typical value for a consumer type 60 & nbsp ; cm satellite dish at 11.75 & nbsp ; ghz is 37.50 & nbsp ; db with lower frequencies , c-band for example , dish designers have a wider choice of materials at higher frequencies , mesh type designs are rarer though some designs have used a solid dish with perforations a common misconception is that the lnbf ( low-noise block/feedhorn ) , the device at the front of the dish , receives the signal directly from the atmosphere in the lnb they become down converted to 950–2150 & nbsp ; mhz , which is the frequency range allocated for the satellite service on the coaxial cable between lnbf and receiver in a single receiver residential installation there is a single coaxial cable running from the receiver set-top box in the building to the lnb on the dish thumb a satellite finder ( or sat finder ) is a satellite field strength meter used to accurately point satellite dishes at communications satellites in geostationary orbit however , some designs much more effectively optimize simultaneous reception from multiple different satellite positions without re-positioning the dish automatic tracking satellite dish satellitedish1.jpg general electric satellite dish for directv satellite television the first satellite television dishes were built to receive signals on the c-band analog , and were very large this great decrease of dish size also allowed satellite dishes to be installed on vehicles

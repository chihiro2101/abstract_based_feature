mpeg-7 is intended to provide complementary functionality to the previous mpeg standards , representing information about the content , not the content itself ( '' the bits about the bits '' ) mpeg-7 can be used independently of the other mpeg standards - the description might even be attached to an analog movie the representation of audio-visual data in terms of objects , is however very well suited to what will be built on the mpeg-7 standard in addition , mpeg-7 descriptions could be used to improve the functionality of previous mpeg standards.with these tools , we can build an mpeg-7 description and deploy it an mpeg-7 architecture requirement is that description must be separate from the audiovisual content on the right side you can see this relation between description and content mpeg-7 uses the following tools : descriptor ( d ) : it is a representation of a feature defined syntactically and semantically description schemes ( ds ) : specify the structure and semantics of the relations between its components , these components can be descriptors ( d ) or description schemes ( ds ) there are many applications and application domains which will benefit from the mpeg-7 standard tu berlin mpeg-7 audio analyzer ( web-demo ) : creating mpeg-7 documents ( xml ) for audio documents ( wav , mp3 ) the mpeg-7 standard was originally written in xml schema ( xsd ) , which constitutes semi-structured data mpeg-7 overview mpeg-7/-21 community portal

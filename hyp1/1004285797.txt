mpeg-7 is intended to provide complementary functionality to the previous mpeg standards , representing information about the content , not the content itself ( '' the bits about the bits '' ) mpeg-7 can be used independently of the other mpeg standards - the description might even be attached to an analog movie the representation of audio-visual data in terms of objects , is however very well suited to what will be built on the mpeg-7 standard in addition , mpeg-7 descriptions could be used to improve the functionality of previous mpeg standards.with these tools , we can build an mpeg-7 description and deploy it ” a descriptor value is “ an instantiation of a descriptor for a given data set ( or subset thereof ) ” the descriptor is the syntatic and semantic definition of the content extraction algorithms are inside the scope of the standard because their standardization isn ’ t required to allow interoperability the mpeg-7 ( iso/iec 15938 ) consists of different parts an mpeg-7 architecture requirement is that description must be separate from the audiovisual content description definition language ( ddl ) : it is based on xml language used to define the structural relations between descriptors wiley & sons , april 2002 - harald kosch : distributed multimedia database technologies supported by mpeg-7 and mpeg-21 mpeg-7 overview mpeg-7/-21 community portal

mpeg-7 is intended to provide complementary functionality to the previous mpeg standards , representing information about the content , not the content itself ( '' the bits about the bits '' ) mpeg-7 can be used independently of the other mpeg standards - the description might even be attached to an analog movie the representation of audio-visual data in terms of objects , is however very well suited to what will be built on the mpeg-7 standard in addition , mpeg-7 descriptions could be used to improve the functionality of previous mpeg standards.with these tools , we can build an mpeg-7 description and deploy it according to the requirements document,1 â€œ a description consists of a description scheme ( structure ) and the set of descriptor values ( instantiations ) that describe the data relation between description and content an mpeg-7 architecture requirement is that description must be separate from the audiovisual content thus the description is multiplexed with the content itself description schemes ( ds ) : specify the structure and semantics of the relations between its components , these components can be descriptors ( d ) or description schemes ( ds ) description definition language ( ddl ) : it is based on xml language used to define the structural relations between descriptors c implementation : open source implementation of the mpeg-7 descriptors in c manjunath ( editor ) , philippe salembier ( editor ) , and thomas sikora ( editor ) : introduction to mpeg-7 : multimedia content description interface

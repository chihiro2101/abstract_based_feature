karl drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 laufmaschine this was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals , such as the boneshaker , which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel the brake was operated by a lever or by a cord connecting to the handlebars the rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive the next development of the bicycle , the penny-farthings , were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling during its development from 1870 to 1878 , there were various designs for brakes , most of them operating on the rear wheel however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective putting the legs under the handlebars with the feet off the pedals placed on foot-rests on the forks had resulted in serious accidents caused by the feet getting caught in the spokes an alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by browett and harrison in 1887 this early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing 's small rear tyre the 1870s and 1880s saw the development of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today , with two wheels of equal size , initially with solid rubber tyres these were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism , but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears , allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals the relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of rim brakes 594,234 , november 23 , 1897 the duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin rubber rollers against the front tyre , braking the front wheel the coaster brake was contained in the rear wheel hub , and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling , thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear the spoon brake , or plunger brake was probably the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre in developing world , a foot-operated form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters perhaps more so than any other form of bicycle brake , the spoon brake is sensitive to road conditions and increases tyre wear dramatically though made obsolete by the introduction of the duck brake , coaster brake , and rod brake , spoon brakes continued to be used in the west supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s , and on children 's bicycles until the 1950s mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set at an angle to conform to the shape of the tyre , the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre , thus braking the front wheel braking power was enhanced by an extra-long brake lever mounted in parallel with and behind the handlebar , which provided additional leverage when braking ( two hands could be used to pull the lever if necessary ) used in combination with a rear coaster brake , a cyclist of the day could stop much more quickly and with better modulation of braking effort than was possible using only a spoon brake or rear coaster brake 198-233 : the spoon brake was fairly ineffective , while the coaster brake did not operate on the front tyre , the most effective position on a two-wheel vehicle during a hard stop 4951 known colloquially as the duck brake , the design was used by many notable riders of the day , and was widely exported to england , australia , and other countries however , they perform relatively poorly when the rims are wet , and will brake unevenly if the rims are even slightly warped because rims can carry debris from the ground to the brake pads , rim brakes are more prone to clogging with mud or snow than disc brakes ( where braking surfaces are higher from the ground ) , particularly when riding on unpaved surfaces the low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes , where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions the light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles over longer time and use , rims can become worn during braking , the friction surfaces ( brake pads and rims ) will experience thermal heating in normal use this is not a problem , as the brakes are applied with limited force and for a short time , so the heat quickly dissipates to the surrounding air however , on a heavily laden bike on a long descent , heat energy may be added more quickly than it can dissipate causing heat build-up , which may damage components and cause brake failure many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting , or brake shoe , with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake in general , a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads , as long as the mounting is compatible carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads , and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads ceramic pads usually contain chromium compounds to resist heat these salmon-colored pads were first made by scott-mathauser and are now produced by kool-stop this wedges the shoes higher upon the tapered rim , thus increasing the normal force between shoes and rim surface thus the front brake is typically more effective than the rear when the brakes are so mounted a common setup was to combine a front rod brake with a rear coaster brake arms extend around the tyre and end in brake shoes that press against the rim while some designs incorporate dual pivot points & mdash ; the arms pivot on a sub-frame & mdash ; the entire assembly still mounts to a single point thus caliper brakes are rarely found on modern mountain bikes but they are almost ubiquitous on road bikes , particularly the side-pull caliper brakes when the brake lever is squeezed , the arms move together and the brake pads squeeze the rim these brakes are simple and effective for relatively narrow tyres but have significant flex and resulting poor performance if the arms are made long enough to fit wide tyres these brakes are now used on inexpensive bikes ; before the introduction of dual-pivot caliper brakes they were used on all types of road bikes one arm pivots at the centre , like a side-pull ; and the other pivots at the side , like a centre-pull the cable housing attaches like that of a side-pull brake dual-pivot brakes are slightly heavier than conventional side-pull calipers and can not accurately track an out-of-true rim , or a wheel that flexes from side to side in the frame during hard climbing these brakes were reasonably priced , and in the past filled the price niche between the cheaper and the more expensive models of side-pull brakes '' u-brakes '' ( also known by the trademarked term '' 990-style '' ) are essentially the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake the difference is that the two arm pivots attach directly to the frame or fork while those of the centre-pull caliper brake attach to an integral bridge frame that mounts to the frame or fork by a single bolt thus u-brakes are often interchangeable with , and have the same maintenance issues as , roller cam brakes the u-brake 's main advantage over cantilever and linear-pull brakes in this application is that sideways protrusion of the brake and cable system is minimal , and the exposed parts are smooth this is especially valuable on freestyle bmx bikes where any protruding parts are susceptible to damage and may interfere with the rider 's body or clothing the brake shoe is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together low profile brakes require more careful attention to cable geometry than traditional cantilevers but are now the most common type and since the design can provide positive mechanical advantage , maximum clamping force can be higher than that of other types of brakes however , with high leverage , the stroke of the lever is not enough to fully apply the brake , so the rider can have brakes that feel normal in light braking but which can not be applied harder for hard braking the use of very wide tyres favors disc brakes , as rim brakes require ever-longer arms to clear the wider tyre a rim brake works directly on the rim and the attached tyre ; a disc brake applies a potentially large torque moment at the hub there are two main types of disc brake : '' mechanical '' ( cable-actuated ) and hydraulic larger rotors dissipate heat more quickly and have a larger amount of mass to absorb heat , reducing brake fade or failure

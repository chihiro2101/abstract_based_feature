karl drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 laufmaschine this was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals , such as the boneshaker , which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel the brake was operated by a lever or by a cord connecting to the handlebars the rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive the next development of the bicycle , the penny-farthings , were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling during its development from 1870 to 1878 , there were various designs for brakes , most of them operating on the rear wheel however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective the front brake , introduced by john kean in 1873 , had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power some penny-farthing riders used only back pedalling and got off and walked down steep hills , but most also used a brake having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their feet off the pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars , although most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills putting the legs under the handlebars with the feet off the pedals placed on foot-rests on the forks had resulted in serious accidents caused by the feet getting caught in the spokes an alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by browett and harrison in 1887 the 1870s and 1880s saw the development of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today , with two wheels of equal size , initially with solid rubber tyres these were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism , but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears , allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals with the introduction of mass-produced bicycle tire by the dunlop rubber , the use of spoon brakes began to decline , as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres duck of duck 's cyclery in oakland , california was granted a patent for his duck roller brake ( u.s 594,234 in 1898 , after the advent of freewheel coasting mechanisms , the first internal coaster brakes were introduced for the rear wheel in the united states , the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout the first half of the 20th century , often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle the spoon brake , or plunger brake was probably the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre whittbs , pp.153 & ndash ; 154 spoon brakes were used on penny farthings with solid rubber tyres in the 1800s and continued to be used after the introduction of the pneumatic-tyred safety bicycle the spoon brake consists of a pad ( often leather ) or metal shoe ( possibly rubber faced ) , which is pressed onto the top of the front tyre though made obsolete by the introduction of the duck brake , coaster brake , and rod brake , spoon brakes continued to be used in the west supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s , and on children 's bicycles until the 1950s mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set at an angle to conform to the shape of the tyre , the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre , thus braking the front wheel and wilson , david g parliamentary debates : senate and house of representatives , tariff preferences , volume 34 ( 19 september 1906 ) , p bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the duck roller brake ( patent 708,114 ) for use on motorized bicycles ( motorcycles ) rim brakes are so called because braking force is applied by friction pads to the rim of the rotating wheel , thus slowing it and the bicycle rim brakes are typically actuated by a lever mounted on the handlebar the light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles during braking , the friction surfaces ( brake pads and rims ) will experience thermal heating a ceramic coating for the rims is available which may reduce wear and can also improve both wet and dry braking it may also slightly reduce heat transfer to the inside of the rims because it is a thermal insulator many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting , or brake shoe , with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake many pad designs have a rectangular shape ; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim ceramic pads usually contain chromium compounds to resist heat self-assist reduces the input force needed to apply the brake thus the front brake is typically more effective than the rear when the brakes are so mounted types of rim brakes the following are among the many sub-types of rim brakes : rim brakes have been the subject of countless '' engineering innovations '' they were often called '' stirrup brakes '' due to their shape the caliper brake is a class of cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel , theoretically allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim while some designs incorporate dual pivot points & mdash ; the arms pivot on a sub-frame & mdash ; the entire assembly still mounts to a single point thus caliper brakes are rarely found on modern mountain bikes but they are almost ubiquitous on road bikes , particularly the side-pull caliper brakes when the brake lever is squeezed , the arms move together and the brake pads squeeze the rim '' dual-pivot side-pull caliper brakes '' are used on most modern racing bicycles the centering of side-pull brakes was improved with the mass-market adoption of dual-pivot side-pulls ( an old design re-discovered by shimano in the early 1990s ) this type of brake has symmetrical arms and therefore centre more effectively tension on the cable is evenly distributed to the two arms , preventing the brake from taking a '' set '' to one side or the other they are more effective than side-pull brakes in long reach applications as the distance between the pivot and brake pad or cable attachment is much shorter , reducing flex '' u-brakes '' ( also known by the trademarked term '' 990-style '' ) are essentially the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake the difference is that the two arm pivots attach directly to the frame or fork while those of the centre-pull caliper brake attach to an integral bridge frame that mounts to the frame or fork by a single bolt like roller cam brakes , this is a caliper design with pivots located above the rim u-brakes were used on mountain bikes through the early 1990s , particularly under the chainstays , a rear brake mounting location that was then popular the u-brake 's main advantage over cantilever and linear-pull brakes in this application is that sideways protrusion of the brake and cable system is minimal , and the exposed parts are smooth this is especially valuable on freestyle bmx bikes where any protruding parts are susceptible to damage and may interfere with the rider 's body or clothing the cantilever brake is a class of brake in which each arm is attached to a separate pivot point on one side of the seat stay or fork due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads , cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres , such as on mountain bikes because the arms move only in their designed arcs , the brake shoe must be adjustable in several planes many consider the brake attractive , and it has a lower wind profile than some other common brakes it is possible to ride a bicycle with a buckled wheel if it has disc brakes , where it would not be possible with a rim brake because the buckled wheel would bind on the brake pads there are two main types of disc brake : '' mechanical '' ( cable-actuated ) and hydraulic advantages of is six-bolt are that there are more choices when it comes to hubs and rotors larger rotors provide greater braking force for a given pad pressure , by virtue of a longer moment arm for the caliper to act on

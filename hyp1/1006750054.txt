karl drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 laufmaschine this was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals , such as the boneshaker , which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel the rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive the next development of the bicycle , the penny-farthings , were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling during its development from 1870 to 1878 , there were various designs for brakes , most of them operating on the rear wheel however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective the front brake , introduced by john kean in 1873 , had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power an alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by browett and harrison in 1887 this early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing 's small rear tyre the 1870s and 1880s saw the development of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today , with two wheels of equal size , initially with solid rubber tyres these were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism , but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears , allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals the relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of rim brakes with the introduction of mass-produced bicycle tire by the dunlop rubber , the use of spoon brakes began to decline , as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres 594,234 , november 23 , 1897 the duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin rubber rollers against the front tyre , braking the front wheel the coaster brake was contained in the rear wheel hub , and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling , thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear in the united states , the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout the first half of the 20th century , often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle in developing world , a foot-operated form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters invented in 1897 , the duck brake or duck roller brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers ( usually made of wood or rubber ) against the front tyre mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set at an angle to conform to the shape of the tyre , the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre , thus braking the front wheel a tension spring held the rollers away from the tyre except when braking wyman , who crossed the united states aboard a motorized bicycle with a duck roller brake praised its efficiency , stating that '' i controlled my motorbike with it on the steepest grades of the rocky mountains '' rim brakes are so called because braking force is applied by friction pads to the rim of the rotating wheel , thus slowing it and the bicycle brake pads can be made of leather , rubber or cork and are often mounted in metal '' shoes '' rim brakes are typically actuated by a lever mounted on the handlebar however , they perform relatively poorly when the rims are wet , and will brake unevenly if the rims are even slightly warped the light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force , but will wear more slowly ( in relation to thickness ) , so can usually be thinner carbon fiber rims may be more sensitive to damage by incorrectly-matched brake pads , and generally must use non-abrasive cork pads ceramic pads usually contain chromium compounds to resist heat for wet-weather use , brake pads containing iron ( iii ) oxide are sometimes used as these have higher friction on a wet aluminum rim than the usual rubber the friction force between brake shoe and rim creates a bending moment around the point where the brake bolt emerges from the fork thus the front brake is typically more effective than the rear when the brakes are so mounted the following are among the many sub-types of rim brakes : rim brakes have been the subject of countless '' engineering innovations '' the caliper brake is a class of cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel , theoretically allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim caliper brakes tend to become less effective as tyres get wider , and so deeper , reducing the brakes ' mechanical advantage thus caliper brakes are rarely found on modern mountain bikes these brakes are simple and effective for relatively narrow tyres but have significant flex and resulting poor performance if the arms are made long enough to fit wide tyres these brakes are now used on inexpensive bikes ; before the introduction of dual-pivot caliper brakes they were used on all types of road bikes '' dual-pivot side-pull caliper brakes '' are used on most modern racing bicycles the cable housing attaches like that of a side-pull brake the centering of side-pull brakes was improved with the mass-market adoption of dual-pivot side-pulls ( an old design re-discovered by shimano in the early 1990s ) tension on the cable is evenly distributed to the two arms , preventing the brake from taking a '' set '' to one side or the other these brakes were reasonably priced , and in the past filled the price niche between the cheaper and the more expensive models of side-pull brakes they are more effective than side-pull brakes in long reach applications as the distance between the pivot and brake pad or cable attachment is much shorter , reducing flex like roller cam brakes , this is a caliper design with pivots located above the rim thus u-brakes are often interchangeable with , and have the same maintenance issues as , roller cam brakes this location usually benefits from higher frame stiffness , an important consideration with a powerful brake since flex in the stays will increase lever travel and reduce effective braking force the cantilever brake is a class of brake in which each arm is attached to a separate pivot point on one side of the seat stay or fork the brake shoe is mounted below the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are forced apart thus cantilever brake shoes are notoriously difficult to adjust there are several brake types based on the cantilever brake design : cantilever brakes and v-brakes - both second class lever designs - and roller cam brakes and u-brakes - both first class lever designs '' low profile '' cantilevers were designed to overcome this , where the arms are closer to 45 degrees from horizontal traditional cantilever brakes are difficult to adapt to bicycle suspensions and protrude somewhat from the frame '' linear-pull brakes '' or '' direct-pull brakes '' , commonly referred to by shimano 's trademark '' v-brakes '' , are a side-pull version of cantilever brakes and mount on the same frame bosses however , the arms are longer , with the cable housing attached to one arm and the cable to the other as the cable pulls against the housing the arms are drawn together and since the arms move the same distance that the cable moves with regard to its housing , the design is also called '' linear-pull '' v-brakes function well with the suspension systems found on many mountain bikes because they do not require a separate cable stop on the frame or fork because of the higher mechanical advantage of v-brakes , they require brake levers with longer cable travel than levers intended for older types of brakes the '' delta brake '' is a road bicycle brake named due to its triangular shape an engineered disc brake would reduce weight by not having most of the metal rim components a front disc brake places a bending moment on the fork between the caliper anchor points and the tip of the dropout disc brakes heat discs in the same way as rim brakes heat rims , but discs provide an inherently smaller surface to dissipate heat dual actuation can move both pads relative to the caliper , or can move one pad relative to the caliper , then move the caliper and other pad relative to the rotor , called a '' floating caliper '' design it is also common to use a larger diameter rotor on the front wheel and a smaller rotor on the rear wheel since the front wheel does the most braking ( up to 90 % of the total )

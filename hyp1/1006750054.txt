karl drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 laufmaschine the next development of the bicycle , the penny-farthings , were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling during its development from 1870 to 1878 , there were various designs for brakes , most of them operating on the rear wheel however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their feet off the pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars , although most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills an alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by browett and harrison in 1887 this early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing 's small rear tyre the 1870s and 1880s saw the development of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today , with two wheels of equal size , initially with solid rubber tyres these were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism , but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears , allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals with the introduction of mass-produced bicycle tire by the dunlop rubber , the use of spoon brakes began to decline , as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres 594,234 in 1898 , after the advent of freewheel coasting mechanisms , the first internal coaster brakes were introduced for the rear wheel in the united states , the coaster brake was the most commonly fitted brake throughout the first half of the 20th century , often comprising the only braking system on the bicycle the spoon brake , or plunger brake was probably the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre whittbs , pp.153 & ndash ; 154 spoon brakes were used on penny farthings with solid rubber tyres in the 1800s and continued to be used after the introduction of the pneumatic-tyred safety bicycle the spoon brake consists of a pad ( often leather ) or metal shoe ( possibly rubber faced ) , which is pressed onto the top of the front tyre in developing world , a foot-operated form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters it consists of a spring-loaded flap attached to the back of the fork crown perhaps more so than any other form of bicycle brake , the spoon brake is sensitive to road conditions and increases tyre wear dramatically though made obsolete by the introduction of the duck brake , coaster brake , and rod brake , spoon brakes continued to be used in the west supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s , and on children 's bicycles until the 1950s jpg spoon brake on front wheel file : marian038.jpg improvised spoon brake on a chinese cargo tricycle invented in 1897 , the duck brake or duck roller brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers ( usually made of wood or rubber ) against the front tyre mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set at an angle to conform to the shape of the tyre , the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre , thus braking the front wheel 4951 known colloquially as the duck brake , the design was used by many notable riders of the day , and was widely exported to england , australia , and other countries brake pads can be made of leather , rubber or cork and are often mounted in metal '' shoes '' rim brakes are inexpensive , light , mechanically simple , easy to maintain , and powerful however , they perform relatively poorly when the rims are wet , and will brake unevenly if the rims are even slightly warped the low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes , where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal , the pads may lose their centering as they wear , causing the pads to wear unevenly if a rim has a pronounced wobble , then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven , and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied many pad designs have a rectangular shape ; others are longer and curved to match the radius of the rim larger pads do not necessarily provide more braking force , but will wear more slowly ( in relation to thickness ) , so can usually be thinner in general , a brake can be fitted with a variety of pads , as long as the mounting is compatible this wedges the shoes higher upon the tapered rim , thus increasing the normal force between shoes and rim surface thus the front brake is typically more effective than the rear when the brakes are so mounted types of rim brakes the design is still in use , typically on african and asian roadsters such as the sohrab and flying pigeon the caliper brake is a class of cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel , theoretically allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim arms extend around the tyre and end in brake shoes that press against the rim '' single-pivot side-pull caliper brakes '' consist of two curved arms that cross at a pivot above the wheel and hold the brake pads on opposite sides of the rim when the brake lever is squeezed , the arms move together and the brake pads squeeze the rim if not adjusted properly , low-quality varieties tend to rotate to one side during actuation and tend to stay there , making it difficult to evenly space brake shoes away from the rim '' dual-pivot side-pull caliper brakes '' are used on most modern racing bicycles this type of brake has symmetrical arms and therefore centre more effectively these brakes were reasonably priced , and in the past filled the price niche between the cheaper and the more expensive models of side-pull brakes they are more effective than side-pull brakes in long reach applications as the distance between the pivot and brake pad or cable attachment is much shorter , reducing flex thus u-brakes are often interchangeable with , and have the same maintenance issues as , roller cam brakes thus all cantilever brakes are dual-pivot the brake shoe is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together in the first-class lever design , the arm pivots above the rim due to a wider possible distance between the mounts and pads , cantilever brakes are often preferred for bicycles that use wide tyres , such as on mountain bikes because the arms move only in their designed arcs , the brake shoe must be adjustable in several planes as the brake shoes of a second-class cantilever brake wears , they ride lower on the rim eventually , one may go underneath the rim , so that the brake does not function originally , cantilever brakes had nearly horizontal arms and were designed for maximum clearance on touring or cyclo-cross bicycles low profile brakes require more careful attention to cable geometry than traditional cantilevers but are now the most common type traditional cantilever brakes are difficult to adapt to bicycle suspensions and protrude somewhat from the frame however , the arms are longer , with the cable housing attached to one arm and the cable to the other since there is no intervening mechanism between the cable and the arms , the design is called '' direct-pull '' some high-end v-brakes use a four-pivot parallel motion so the brake pads contact at virtually the same position on the wheel rim regardless of wear this reduces the required cable pull , making them compatible with brake levers intended for cantilever brakes disc brakes require a hub built to accept the disc , and a fork ( for front brakes ) or frame ( for rear brakes ) built to accept the caliper there are two main types of disc brake : '' mechanical '' ( cable-actuated ) and hydraulic many disc brakes have their pads actuated from both sides of the caliper , while some have only one pad that moves it is also common to use a larger diameter rotor on the front wheel and a smaller rotor on the rear wheel since the front wheel does the most braking ( up to 90 % of the total )

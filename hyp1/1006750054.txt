karl drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 laufmaschine this was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals , such as the boneshaker , which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel the rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive during its development from 1870 to 1878 , there were various designs for brakes , most of them operating on the rear wheel however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective the front brake , introduced by john kean in 1873 , had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their feet off the pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars , although most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills an alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by browett and harrison in 1887 this early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing 's small rear tyre the 1870s and 1880s saw the development of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today , with two wheels of equal size , initially with solid rubber tyres these were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism , but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears , allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals with the introduction of mass-produced bicycle tire by the dunlop rubber , the use of spoon brakes began to decline , as they tended to quickly wear through the thin casing of the new tyres , united states patent office , letters patent no 594,234 , november 23 , 1897 the duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin rubber rollers against the front tyre , braking the front wheel 594,234 in 1898 , after the advent of freewheel coasting mechanisms , the first internal coaster brakes were introduced for the rear wheel whittbs , pp.153 & ndash ; 154 spoon brakes were used on penny farthings with solid rubber tyres in the 1800s and continued to be used after the introduction of the pneumatic-tyred safety bicycle the spoon brake consists of a pad ( often leather ) or metal shoe ( possibly rubber faced ) , which is pressed onto the top of the front tyre in developing world , a foot-operated form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters perhaps more so than any other form of bicycle brake , the spoon brake is sensitive to road conditions and increases tyre wear dramatically though made obsolete by the introduction of the duck brake , coaster brake , and rod brake , spoon brakes continued to be used in the west supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s , and on children 's bicycles until the 1950s invented in 1897 , the duck brake or duck roller brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers ( usually made of wood or rubber ) against the front tyre 4951 known colloquially as the duck brake , the design was used by many notable riders of the day , and was widely exported to england , australia , and other countries 708,114 , september 2 , 1902 duck brake company , testimonial of geo rim brakes are so called because braking force is applied by friction pads to the rim of the rotating wheel , thus slowing it and the bicycle because rims can carry debris from the ground to the brake pads , rim brakes are more prone to clogging with mud or snow than disc brakes ( where braking surfaces are higher from the ground ) , particularly when riding on unpaved surfaces the low price and ease of maintenance of rim brakes makes them popular in low- to mid-price commuter bikes , where the disadvantages are alleviated by the unchallenging conditions rim brakes require regular maintenance as they wear down , their position may need to be adjusted as the material wears away because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal , the pads may lose their centering as they wear , causing the pads to wear unevenly if a rim has a pronounced wobble , then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven , and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied it may also slightly reduce heat transfer to the inside of the rims because it is a thermal insulator many consist of a replaceable rubber pad held on a mounting , or brake shoe , with a post or bolt on the back to attach to the brake for wet-weather use , brake pads containing iron ( iii ) oxide are sometimes used as these have higher friction on a wet aluminum rim than the usual rubber the following are among the many sub-types of rim brakes : rim brakes have been the subject of countless '' engineering innovations '' they were often called '' stirrup brakes '' due to their shape the caliper brake is a class of cable-actuated brake in which the brake mounts to a single point above the wheel , theoretically allowing the arms to auto-centre on the rim '' single-pivot side-pull caliper brakes '' consist of two curved arms that cross at a pivot above the wheel and hold the brake pads on opposite sides of the rim when the brake lever is squeezed , the arms move together and the brake pads squeeze the rim these brakes are now used on inexpensive bikes ; before the introduction of dual-pivot caliper brakes they were used on all types of road bikes '' dual-pivot side-pull caliper brakes '' are used on most modern racing bicycles the centering of side-pull brakes was improved with the mass-market adoption of dual-pivot side-pulls ( an old design re-discovered by shimano in the early 1990s ) these brakes were reasonably priced , and in the past filled the price niche between the cheaper and the more expensive models of side-pull brakes the difference is that the two arm pivots attach directly to the frame or fork while those of the centre-pull caliper brake attach to an integral bridge frame that mounts to the frame or fork by a single bolt thus u-brakes are often interchangeable with , and have the same maintenance issues as , roller cam brakes this location usually benefits from higher frame stiffness , an important consideration with a powerful brake since flex in the stays will increase lever travel and reduce effective braking force unfortunately it is also very prone to clogging by mud , which meant that u-brakes quickly fell out of favour on cross-country bikes the u-brake 's main advantage over cantilever and linear-pull brakes in this application is that sideways protrusion of the brake and cable system is minimal , and the exposed parts are smooth both first- and second-class lever designs exist ; second-class is by far the most common in the second-class lever design , the arm pivots below the rim in the first-class lever design , the arm pivots above the rim the brake shoe is mounted below the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are forced apart thus cantilever brake shoes are notoriously difficult to adjust as the brake shoes of a second-class cantilever brake wears , they ride lower on the rim eventually , one may go underneath the rim , so that the brake does not function it is a centre-pull cantilever design with an outwardly angled arm protruding on each side , a cable stop on the frame or fork to terminate the cable housing , and a straddle cable between the arms similar to centre-pull caliper brakes '' linear-pull brakes '' or '' direct-pull brakes '' , commonly referred to by shimano 's trademark '' v-brakes '' , are a side-pull version of cantilever brakes and mount on the same frame bosses however , the arms are longer , with the cable housing attached to one arm and the cable to the other and since the arms move the same distance that the cable moves with regard to its housing , the design is also called '' linear-pull '' some high-end v-brakes use a four-pivot parallel motion so the brake pads contact at virtually the same position on the wheel rim regardless of wear because of the higher mechanical advantage of v-brakes , they require brake levers with longer cable travel than levers intended for older types of brakes the use of very wide tyres favors disc brakes , as rim brakes require ever-longer arms to clear the wider tyre a rim brake works directly on the rim and the attached tyre ; a disc brake applies a potentially large torque moment at the hub the problem has occurred when the brake pads and dropouts are aligned so the brake reaction force tends to eject the wheel from the dropout it is also common to use a larger diameter rotor on the front wheel and a smaller rotor on the rear wheel since the front wheel does the most braking ( up to 90 % of the total )

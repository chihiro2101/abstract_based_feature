karl drais included a pivoting brake shoe that could be pressed against the rear iron tyre of his 1817 laufmaschine this was continued on the earliest bicycles with pedals , such as the boneshaker , which were fitted with a spoon brake to press onto the rear wheel the rider could also slow down by resisting the pedals of the fixed wheel drive the next development of the bicycle , the penny-farthings , were similarly braked with a spoon brake or by back pedalling during its development from 1870 to 1878 , there were various designs for brakes , most of them operating on the rear wheel however , as the rear wheel became smaller and smaller , with more of the rider 's weight over the front wheel , braking on the rear wheel became less effective the front brake , introduced by john kean in 1873 , had been generally adopted by 1880 because of its greater stopping power some penny-farthing riders used only back pedalling and got off and walked down steep hills , but most also used a brake having a brake meant that riders could coast down hill by taking their feet off the pedals and placing the legs over the handlebars , although most riders preferred to dismount and walk down steep hills an alternative to the spoon brake for penny-farthings was the caliper brake patented by browett and harrison in 1887 this early version of caliper braking used a rubber block to contact the outside of the penny-farthing 's small rear tyre the 1870s and 1880s saw the development of the safety bicycle which roughly resembles bicycles today , with two wheels of equal size , initially with solid rubber tyres these were typically equipped with a front spoon brake and no rear brake mechanism , but like penny-farthings they used fixed gears , allowing rear wheel braking by resisting the motion of the pedals the relative fragility of the wooden rims used on most bicycles still precluded the use of rim brakes duck of duck 's cyclery in oakland , california was granted a patent for his duck roller brake ( u.s 594,234 , november 23 , 1897 the duck brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin rubber rollers against the front tyre , braking the front wheel the coaster brake was contained in the rear wheel hub , and was engaged and controlled by backpedaling , thus eliminating the issue of tyre wear the spoon brake , or plunger brake was probably the first type of bicycle brake and precedes the pneumatic tyre the spoon brake consists of a pad ( often leather ) or metal shoe ( possibly rubber faced ) , which is pressed onto the top of the front tyre in developing world , a foot-operated form of the spoon brake sometimes is retrofitted to old rod brake roadsters this is depressed against the front tyre by the rider 's foot perhaps more so than any other form of bicycle brake , the spoon brake is sensitive to road conditions and increases tyre wear dramatically though made obsolete by the introduction of the duck brake , coaster brake , and rod brake , spoon brakes continued to be used in the west supplementally on adult bicycles until the 1930s , and on children 's bicycles until the 1950s in the developing world , they were manufactured until much more recently invented in 1897 , the duck brake or duck roller brake used a rod operated by a lever on the handlebar to pull twin friction rollers ( usually made of wood or rubber ) against the front tyre mounted on axles secured by friction washers and set at an angle to conform to the shape of the tyre , the rollers were forced against their friction washers upon contacting the tyre , thus braking the front wheel 198-233 : the spoon brake was fairly ineffective , while the coaster brake did not operate on the front tyre , the most effective position on a two-wheel vehicle during a hard stop bill was granted a patent for an improved version of the duck roller brake ( patent 708,114 ) for use on motorized bicycles ( motorcycles ) rim brakes are so called because braking force is applied by friction pads to the rim of the rotating wheel , thus slowing it and the bicycle brake pads can be made of leather , rubber or cork and are often mounted in metal '' shoes '' because rims can carry debris from the ground to the brake pads , rim brakes are more prone to clogging with mud or snow than disc brakes ( where braking surfaces are higher from the ground ) , particularly when riding on unpaved surfaces the light weight of rim brakes also makes them desirable in road racing bicycles rim brakes require regular maintenance because the motion of most brakes is not perfectly horizontal , the pads may lose their centering as they wear , causing the pads to wear unevenly if a rim has a pronounced wobble , then the braking force may be intermittent or uneven , and the pads may rub the rims even when the brake is not applied in normal use this is not a problem , as the brakes are applied with limited force and for a short time , so the heat quickly dissipates to the surrounding air it may also slightly reduce heat transfer to the inside of the rims because it is a thermal insulator rear brakes mounted behind the seat-tube supports experience precisely the opposite effect thus the front brake is typically more effective than the rear when the brakes are so mounted the following are among the many sub-types of rim brakes : rim brakes have been the subject of countless '' engineering innovations '' a common setup was to combine a front rod brake with a rear coaster brake caliper brakes tend to become less effective as tyres get wider , and so deeper , reducing the brakes ' mechanical advantage but they are almost ubiquitous on road bikes , particularly the side-pull caliper brakes '' single-pivot side-pull caliper brakes '' consist of two curved arms that cross at a pivot above the wheel and hold the brake pads on opposite sides of the rim these arms have extensions on one side , one attached to the cable , the other to the cable housing when the brake lever is squeezed , the arms move together and the brake pads squeeze the rim these brakes are now used on inexpensive bikes ; before the introduction of dual-pivot caliper brakes they were used on all types of road bikes '' dual-pivot side-pull caliper brakes '' are used on most modern racing bicycles one arm pivots at the centre , like a side-pull ; and the other pivots at the side , like a centre-pull the centering of side-pull brakes was improved with the mass-market adoption of dual-pivot side-pulls ( an old design re-discovered by shimano in the early 1990s ) this type of brake has symmetrical arms and therefore centre more effectively tension on the cable is evenly distributed to the two arms , preventing the brake from taking a '' set '' to one side or the other these brakes were reasonably priced , and in the past filled the price niche between the cheaper and the more expensive models of side-pull brakes they are more effective than side-pull brakes in long reach applications as the distance between the pivot and brake pad or cable attachment is much shorter , reducing flex it is important that the fixed bridge holding the pivots is very stiff '' u-brakes '' ( also known by the trademarked term '' 990-style '' ) are essentially the same design as the centre-pull caliper brake u-brakes were used on mountain bikes through the early 1990s , particularly under the chainstays , a rear brake mounting location that was then popular the u-brake 's main advantage over cantilever and linear-pull brakes in this application is that sideways protrusion of the brake and cable system is minimal , and the exposed parts are smooth the cantilever brake is a class of brake in which each arm is attached to a separate pivot point on one side of the seat stay or fork in the second-class lever design , the arm pivots below the rim the brake shoe is mounted above the pivot and is pressed against the rim as the two arms are drawn together unlike some rarer rim brake designs , disc brakes are compatible with bicycle suspension there are two main types of disc brake : '' mechanical '' ( cable-actuated ) and hydraulic 245 : '' the front brake therefore has to provide 90 percent of the total retarding force at a deceleration of 0.5 g

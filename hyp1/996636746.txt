am with the first shots fired around 8 & nbsp ; am , but the attack was not fully developed until 9 & nbsp ; am this move threatened either an envelopment of the french right , or a further advance to cut the french line of communication with milan when gardanne 's division was exhausted , victor pulled it back behind the fontanone and committed his second division under gdd chambarlhac ( this officer soon lost his nerve and fled ) the french held marengo village and the line of the fontanone until about noon , with both flanks in the air first , at 8 & nbsp ; am , melas hurled fml karl joseph hadik von futak 's division ( four battalions ) at victor 's defenses , supported by frimont 's advance guard battery along the stream the austrian commander then committed fml konrad valentin von kaim 's division but this attack was also thwarted by 11 & nbsp ; am 151 besides delaying the crossing of the austrian left wing , this also meant that , being 30 kilometers away , nimptsch 's brigade would play no part in the battle it took bonaparte ( 5 kilometers away from marengo ) until about 10 & nbsp ; am to recognize that the austrian activity was not a diversionary attack to cover the anticipated retreat by melas a small part of the 6 ème légère ( 6 th light infantry regiment ) occupied castel ceriolo to the north , but soon ott 's lead units took it around 11:30 & nbsp ; am and began putting pressure on the french right flank ott could not see any sign of the expected main french advance from sale ( to the northeast ) , so he sent gm friedrich heinrich von gottesheim ’ s reinforced advance guard to outflank lannes north of marengo he sent urgent recalls to his recently detached forces and summoned up his last reserves as they came up , gdd jean-charles monnier 's division and the consular guard were committed to extend and shore up the french right , rather than to try to hold marengo where victor 's men were running short of ammunition the marengo farm garrison was abandoned and at around 2:30 & nbsp ; pm melas led two cavalry squadrons to capture them as the austrian infantry deployed on the south side of the road , the 9 ème légère conducted a steady withdrawal for 30 minutes back to desaix 's position 180–181 ott with the austrian left failed to intervene and found his retreat through castel ceriolo blocked by french troops advancing northwest from the centre , but managed to fight his way back to the bormida bridgehead french casualties ( killed and wounded ) were on the order of 4,700 and 900 missing or captured , but they retained the battlefield and the strategic initiative then , chasseloup gave napoleon the founding stone , on which was inscribed : '' napoleon , emperor of the french and king of italy , to the manes of the defenders of the fatherland who perished on the day of marengo battle of marengo in the memoirs of captain coignet gaspar cugnac , campaign of the army of the reserve in 1800 french scans and ocr complete , english translation for vol 1 only , use french version for the battle proper

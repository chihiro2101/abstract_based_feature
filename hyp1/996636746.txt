the battle of marengo was the victory that sealed the success of bonaparte 's italian campaign of 1800 and is best understood in the context of that campaign 63 with his army of the reserve ( officially commanded by louis alexandre berthier ) in mid-may 1800 almost before the passes were open , bonaparte ( who crossed on a mule ) had threatened melas ' lines of communications in northern italy the french army then seized milan on 2 june , followed by pavia , piacenza and stradella , lombardy , cutting the main austrian supply route eastward along the south bank of the po river jean lannes beat feldmarschallleutnant peter ott in the battle of montebello he became convinced that melas would not attack and , further , that the austrians were about to retreat as other french forces closed from the west and south , the austrian commander had withdrawn most of his troops from their positions near nice and genoa to alessandria on the main turin-mantua road the spy would advise bonaparte to march via sale on the northern side of the plain , so that he could be engaged by the austrian left wing ; meanwhile the main force would move through marengo village in the centre , turn north and fall into the french left flank nonetheless , by abandoning the san giuliano plain , where the superior austrian cavalry could have given him an edge , melas probably made a serious mistake claude victor-perrin , supported by divisional general joachim murat ’ s cavalry , swiftly evicted fml andreas o'reilly von ballinlough ’ s austrian brigade from marengo village that afternoon austrian headquarters debated building a bridge to the north to outflank the french , but the lack of pontoons and time forced the austrians to cross the river bormida and then launch a single , direct assault across the fontanone bridge the battle took place to the east of alessandria , on a plain crossed by a river forming meanders , the bormida , over which the austrians installed a bridgehead the three main sites of the battle formed a triangle , with marengo in the west , castel ceriolo in the north and san giuliano vecchio in the east long distances from the home bases , from which the regiments drew reinforcements , meant that troop transports had to endure miserable conditions , so only about 15 % reached the field army in the north ott commanded friedrich heinrich von gottesheim 's advance guard plus joseph von schellenberg and ludwig von vogelsang 's divisions melas himself took control of the center , with the divisions of karl joseph hadik von futak , konrad valentin von kaim , ferdinand johann von morzin and anton von elsnitz supplies of all sorts were inadequate , discipline was breaking down , desertion was increasing and , on a few occasions , whole formations marched to the rear in search of food hollins , the battle of marengo 1800 , p victor was the one who would bear the brunt of the austrian attack poor austrian staff work prevented any rapid development of their attack and the entire army had to file through a narrow bridgehead the austrian centre ( about 18,000 under melas ) advanced towards marengo until halted by gdd gardanne 's french infantry deployed in front of the fontanone stream first , at 8 & nbsp ; am , melas hurled fml karl joseph hadik von futak 's division ( four battalions ) at victor 's defenses , supported by frimont 's advance guard battery along the stream 151 besides delaying the crossing of the austrian left wing , this also meant that , being 30 kilometers away , nimptsch 's brigade would play no part in the battle gm friedrich joseph anton von bellegarde ’ s part of kaim 's division had crossed the fontanone north of marengo and occupied la barbotta farm they briefly crossed the fontanone before austrian reserve guns drove the french back kellermann 's heavy cavalry brigade and the 8 th dragoons took up a covering position on the left , smashing an attempt by gm giovanni pilatti 's light dragoon brigade which attempted to cross the steep-sided fontanone at its southern end to envelop victor 's flank on the right , gdb pierre champeaux was killed trying to stop the progress of ott 's column a small part of the 6 ème légère ( 6 th light infantry regiment ) occupied castel ceriolo to the north , but soon ott 's lead units took it around 11:30 & nbsp ; am and began putting pressure on the french right flank ott could not see any sign of the expected main french advance from sale ( to the northeast ) , so he sent gm friedrich heinrich von gottesheim ’ s reinforced advance guard to outflank lannes north of marengo as they came up , gdd jean-charles monnier 's division and the consular guard were committed to extend and shore up the french right , rather than to try to hold marengo where victor 's men were running short of ammunition although rivaud retook the village , o ’ reilly had taken stortiglione by 2:00 & nbsp ; pm , and in the north , ott prepared to send fml joseph von schellenberg ’ s column to support gottesheim at about 2:00 & nbsp ; pm the french attacked castel ceriolo and delayed the advance of schellenberg 's column by attacking its tail about the same time , marengo had fallen to the austrians , forcing napoleon 's men into a general retreat on the austrian right wing , o'reilly wasted time hunting down a 300-man french detachment led by achille dampierre ( which was finally captured ) and moved southeast there he had placed gdb louis charles de guénand 's brigade on the north side while most of the remaining french army ( monnier and lannes ) were forming up north from there berthier suggests that time had to be given to desaix and boudet 's division to occupy their positions : '' the enemy general misinterpreted this maneuver and thought the army was in full retreat , while in reality it was only executing a movement of conversion napoleon ordered that several ships of the french navy be named marengo , including sceptre ( 1780 ) , jean-jacques rousseau ( 1795 ) , ville de paris ( 1851 ) and marengo ( 1810 ) furthermore , napoleon 's mount throughout the battle was named marengo and further carried the emperor in the battle of austerlitz , battle of jena-auerstedt , battle of wagram , and battle of waterloo battle of marengo in the memoirs of captain coignet gaspar cugnac , campaign of the army of the reserve in 1800 french scans and ocr complete , english translation for vol 1 only , use french version for the battle proper

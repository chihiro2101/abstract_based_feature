the battle of marengo was the victory that sealed the success of bonaparte 's italian campaign of 1800 and is best understood in the context of that campaign 63 with his army of the reserve ( officially commanded by louis alexandre berthier ) in mid-may 1800 almost before the passes were open , bonaparte ( who crossed on a mule ) had threatened melas ' lines of communications in northern italy the french army then seized milan on 2 june , followed by pavia , piacenza and stradella , lombardy , cutting the main austrian supply route eastward along the south bank of the po river he became convinced that melas would not attack and , further , that the austrians were about to retreat as other french forces closed from the west and south , the austrian commander had withdrawn most of his troops from their positions near nice and genoa to alessandria on the main turin-mantua road the austrians planned to fight their way out eastward but—using a local double agent , usually known by his cover of françois toli—attempted to deceive bonaparte into thinking they would try to march north , cross the po and head for milan , joined by the remaining troops marching up from genoa the spy would advise bonaparte to march via sale on the northern side of the plain , so that he could be engaged by the austrian left wing ; meanwhile the main force would move through marengo village in the centre , turn north and fall into the french left flank the senior generals of the austrian army strongly approved this plan , as the alternative would have meant that the army would have had to retreat along the river po and leave piedmont to the enemy without a fight nonetheless , by abandoning the san giuliano plain , where the superior austrian cavalry could have given him an edge , melas probably made a serious mistake claude victor-perrin , supported by divisional general joachim murat ’ s cavalry , swiftly evicted fml andreas o'reilly von ballinlough ’ s austrian brigade from marengo village that afternoon victor then deployed divisional generals gaspard amédée gardanne and jacques-antoine de chambarlhac de laubespin 's divisions along the fontanone stream the battle took place to the east of alessandria , on a plain crossed by a river forming meanders , the bormida , over which the austrians installed a bridgehead the three main sites of the battle formed a triangle , with marengo in the west , castel ceriolo in the north and san giuliano vecchio in the east the 30,000 austrians and their 100 guns were initially opposed by 22,000 french and their 15 guns the army of march 1800 was scarcely larger than at the conclusion of the 1799 campaign supplies of all sorts were inadequate , discipline was breaking down , desertion was increasing and , on a few occasions , whole formations marched to the rear in search of food in establishing the army of the reserve in france , bonaparte 's first move was to overhaul the supply system to provide the troops with regular food and decent uniforms the austrian troops advanced from alessandria eastwards across the bormida river by two bridges debouching in a narrow bend of the river ( the river being not easily crossed elsewhere ) the austrian centre ( about 18,000 under melas ) advanced towards marengo until halted by gdd gardanne 's french infantry deployed in front of the fontanone stream when gardanne 's division was exhausted , victor pulled it back behind the fontanone and committed his second division under gdd chambarlhac ( this officer soon lost his nerve and fled ) the french held marengo village and the line of the fontanone until about noon , with both flanks in the air the austrian commander then committed fml konrad valentin von kaim 's division but this attack was also thwarted by 11 & nbsp ; am 151 besides delaying the crossing of the austrian left wing , this also meant that , being 30 kilometers away , nimptsch 's brigade would play no part in the battle it took bonaparte ( 5 kilometers away from marengo ) until about 10 & nbsp ; am to recognize that the austrian activity was not a diversionary attack to cover the anticipated retreat by melas on the right , gdb pierre champeaux was killed trying to stop the progress of ott 's column a small part of the 6 ème légère ( 6 th light infantry regiment ) occupied castel ceriolo to the north , but soon ott 's lead units took it around 11:30 & nbsp ; am and began putting pressure on the french right flank ott could not see any sign of the expected main french advance from sale ( to the northeast ) , so he sent gm friedrich heinrich von gottesheim ’ s reinforced advance guard to outflank lannes north of marengo as they came up , gdd jean-charles monnier 's division and the consular guard were committed to extend and shore up the french right , rather than to try to hold marengo where victor 's men were running short of ammunition austrian breakout across the fontanone toward 12:30 & nbsp ; pm lannes moved the rest of his force to face gottesheim in a hook shape , while kaim attacked again , but this time against victor 's wings after driving off austrian dragoons with the aid of gdb champeaux 's remaining cavalry ( under joachim murat ) , they engaged the head of the column with the french outnumbered and driven from their best defensive position , the battle was as good as won by the austrians however , desaix , in charge of the force bonaparte had detached southwards , had hastened his advance and reached a small road junction north of cascina grossa ( 3 km west of san giuliano ) the 9 ème légère halted to face the main austrian advance and marmont 's guns blasted the austrians with grapeshot at close range berthier suggests that time had to be given to desaix and boudet 's division to occupy their positions : '' the enemy general misinterpreted this maneuver and thought the army was in full retreat , while in reality it was only executing a movement of conversion the museum of marengo '' museo della battaglia di marengo '' is located in via della barbotta , spinetta marengo , alessandria napoleon ordered that several ships of the french navy be named marengo , including sceptre ( 1780 ) , jean-jacques rousseau ( 1795 ) , ville de paris ( 1851 ) and marengo ( 1810 ) battle of marengo in the memoirs of captain coignet gaspar cugnac , campaign of the army of the reserve in 1800 french scans and ocr complete , english translation for vol 1 only , use french version for the battle proper

the restoration church of god ; the church of god ( boise city ) in boise city , oklahoma ; marvin faulhaber 's sabbatarian , a group also known as church of god ( sabbatarian ) ; and the fountain of life fellowship of james and virginia porter these factions survived well past herbert armstrong 's death in 1986 , most retaining the name church of god because armstrong had pointed out that this is the name god calls his church in the bible during the 1960s , '' armstrong had sought to put into stronger action what he later termed god â€™ s way of give '' the foundation 's efforts reached into several countries , providing staffing and funds to fight illiteracy , to create schools for the disabled , to set up mobile schools , and to conduct several archaeological digs at significant biblical sites 25-26 nevertheless , ticket sales could still not pay for the appearances of world-renowned performers , so armstrong used church tithe money to subsidize these performances without informing his congregation of how '' god 's holy tithe '' was being spent ( the use of the year 1975 was defended by church ministers as a device to explain biblical prophecy , by contrasting it with the scientific world 's declaration of 1975 as the year of technological '' utopia '' ) many members were disappointed that the events predicted in biblical prophecy , expounded and preached about by herbert armstrong , had not yet come to pass he had also read a quote from winston churchill proposing the creation of a united states of europe this was a springboard that the 10 kings , 10 horns , 10 crowns of revelation reveal a european union would rise up to become the beast power garner ted spoke of greatly expanding the church 's media ministry on the model of the church of christ , scientist with its widely read christian science monitor to which herbert w while garner ted armstrong was removed , stanley rader was orchestrating the church 's involvement in a number of corporations which rader and herbert w rader characterized his involvement as that of an adviser and claimed that his advice was opening doors for armstrong that a strict theological role would not have allowed for in 1975 , armstrong baptized stanley rader , who until then had been a practitioner of judaism despite his association with the church the church continued to be headquartered in pasadena garner ted armstrong began his own church in 1978 in tyler , texas , after the rivalry between the younger armstrong and stanley rader intensified armstrong started giving more responsibilities to stanley rader this action was infuriating to the younger armstrong , who thought it his birthright to take over as the leader of the church the adultery problems that reportedly had previously driven garner ted from the church allegedly continued unabated in 1978 , after a failed attempt to seize control of the church from the elder armstrong , garner ted armstrong was disfellowshipped a final time garner ted moved to tyler , texas , and there founded a splinter group , the church of god international several members in good standing with the worldwide church of god at the time prompted the state of california to investigate charges of malfeasance by rader and herbert w wallace showed rader a secret tape recording in which herbert armstrong clearly stated to c shortly before his death , on january 7 , armstrong appointed joseph w 1989 ) church of the great god ( 1992 ) global church of god ( 1992 ) united church of god ( 1995 ) living church of god ( 1998 ) restored church of god ( 1998 ) church of god , a worldwide association ( 2010 ) continuing church of god ( 2012 ) cartwright d

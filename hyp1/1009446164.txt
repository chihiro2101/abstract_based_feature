the radio church of god began with herbert w armstrong , who in 1931 was ordained by the oregon conference of the church of god ( seventh-day ) , an adventist group , and began serving a congregation in eugene , oregon on january 7 , 1934 , armstrong began hosting a broadcast on a local 100-watt radio station kore in eugene it was essentially a condensed church service on the air , with hymn singing featured along with armstrong 's message , and it was the launching point for what would become the radio church of god armstrong moved to pasadena , california to facilitate the work of the growing church , he incorporated it on march 3 , 1946 , as the radio church of god in 1947 , ambassador college was founded in pasadena by the church , and the campus served as the church 's headquarters the broadcast of the world tomorrow went into europe on radio luxembourg on january 7 , 1953 in 1971 armstrong criticized teachings that christ would return in 1975 and that the church should flee to a '' place of safety '' in 1972 , as no man knew the time of christ 's return ( matthew 24:36 and 25:13 ) because of his strong emphasis on these prophetic dates , the church grew quickly in the late 1960s and , on january 5 , 1968 , was renamed the worldwide church of god armstrong 's son , garner ted armstrong , who had been given the responsibility to host the radio and later the television version of the world tomorrow , was formally disfellowshipped by his father in 1972 while church members were told at the time that the reason was ted armstrong 's opposition to some of his father 's teachings , ted armstrong later admitted that the actual reason was his relationships with many women any such disfellowshipments were announced at services , so the congregation as a whole became aware still the church grew on a worldwide scale ten percent of a member 's gross income was to be given to the church , then another ten percent was to be saved for personal expenditures incurred by attendance at the annual holy day celebration 'the feast of tabernacles ' every third year , members gave an additional tithe to help '' widows and orphans '' of the church every month herbert armstrong would write and mail out a 'co-worker ' letter to members and non-members supportive of the work of the church , through their donations armstrong 's mansion was alongside orange grove boulevard , which is part of the route of pasadena 's annual new year 's day 'rose parade ' these factions survived well past herbert armstrong 's death in 1986 , most retaining the name church of god because armstrong had pointed out that this is the name god calls his church in the bible during the 1960s , '' armstrong had sought to put into stronger action what he later termed god â€™ s way of give '' to armstrong and his students , this was generally said to include '' the way of character , generosity , cultural enrichment , true education : of beautifying the environment and caring for fellow man quest publishers hired a professional staff unrelated to the church to create a high-quality , glossy publication devoted to the humanities , travel , and the arts the original name and design of human potential were conceived in the aftermath of armstrong 's poorly received 1975 in prophecy ! , a publication which caused accusations of false prophecy to spread like wildfire ( the use of the year 1975 was defended by church ministers as a device to explain biblical prophecy , by contrasting it with the scientific world 's declaration of 1975 as the year of technological '' utopia '' ) thus , the church began to cut back on its funding many members were disappointed that the events predicted in biblical prophecy , expounded and preached about by herbert armstrong , had not yet come to pass most were unaware that herbert armstrong had been preaching about revelation and bible prophecy on the radio as far back as world war ii after the war ended , armstrong attended a meeting in san francisco in which a proposal was made to create the united nations he had also read a quote from winston churchill proposing the creation of a united states of europe this was a springboard that the 10 kings , 10 horns , 10 crowns of revelation reveal a european union would rise up to become the beast power garner ted spoke of greatly expanding the church 's media ministry on the model of the church of christ , scientist with its widely read christian science monitor to which herbert w herbert armstrong claimed that he did not approve of the establishment of the aicf , which rader set up ostensibly to give the elder armstrong a role as the '' ambassador for world peace without portfolio '' despite the scandals of 1972 , the church continued to grow in the 1970s , with herbert armstrong still at the helm in 1975 , armstrong baptized stanley rader , who until then had been a practitioner of judaism despite his association with the church while armstrong recuperated in his home in arizona , he administered and guided church affairs through stanley rader and the church administration garner ted armstrong began his own church in 1978 in tyler , texas , after the rivalry between the younger armstrong and stanley rader intensified as the accusations of garner ted 's past resurfaced , herbert w this action was infuriating to the younger armstrong , who thought it his birthright to take over as the leader of the church in 1978 , after a failed attempt to seize control of the church from the elder armstrong , garner ted armstrong was disfellowshipped a final time about this time the gap between father and son was set when garner ted threatened to expose the secret of herbert 's molesting his sister in the later 1930s armstrong and stanley rader were siphoning millions of dollars for their personal indulgences , the attorney general 's office seized the pasadena campus several members in good standing with the worldwide church of god at the time prompted the state of california to investigate charges of malfeasance by rader and herbert w armstrong , stanley rader , or the worldwide church of god until armstrong 's death , the worldwide church of god adhered to its founder 's teachings armstrong also taught that members of the church would actually become members of the god family themselves after the resurrection the first tithe , 10 percent of a member 's total income , was sent to church headquarters to finance '' the work '' , which was all operations of the church , as well as broadcasting and publishing the church 's message worldwide church of god organizational splits resulted in the establishment of the global church of god , the living church of god ( 1993 , 1998 ) , the united church of god ( 1995 ) , and the restored church of god ( 1998 )

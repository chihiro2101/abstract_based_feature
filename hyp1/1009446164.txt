the radio church of god began with herbert w armstrong , who in 1931 was ordained by the oregon conference of the church of god ( seventh-day ) , an adventist group , and began serving a congregation in eugene , oregon on january 7 , 1934 , armstrong began hosting a broadcast on a local 100-watt radio station kore in eugene it was essentially a condensed church service on the air , with hymn singing featured along with armstrong 's message , and it was the launching point for what would become the radio church of god armstrong , who sided with the faction centered in salem , west virginia , fell out with the local congregation over various doctrinal issues , especially his espousal of british israelism although his views were rejected by the local congregation , he gained a growing following of his own , chiefly through his world tomorrow broadcasts and the plain truth magazine to facilitate the work of the growing church , he incorporated it on march 3 , 1946 , as the radio church of god in 1947 , ambassador college was founded in pasadena by the church , and the campus served as the church 's headquarters in 1971 armstrong criticized teachings that christ would return in 1975 and that the church should flee to a '' place of safety '' in 1972 , as no man knew the time of christ 's return ( matthew 24:36 and 25:13 ) because of his strong emphasis on these prophetic dates , the church grew quickly in the late 1960s and , on january 5 , 1968 , was renamed the worldwide church of god armstrong 's son , garner ted armstrong , who had been given the responsibility to host the radio and later the television version of the world tomorrow , was formally disfellowshipped by his father in 1972 while church members were told at the time that the reason was ted armstrong 's opposition to some of his father 's teachings , ted armstrong later admitted that the actual reason was his relationships with many women herbert armstrong , who resumed the broadcasting duties of the world tomorrow program , did not reconcile with ted before his death he explained that those '' called '' by god , who believed the gospel of the kingdom , and received god 's spirit upon full-immersion baptism , became part of the true , biblical , 'church of god ' every third year , members gave an additional tithe to help '' widows and orphans '' of the church every month herbert armstrong would write and mail out a 'co-worker ' letter to members and non-members supportive of the work of the church , through their donations armstrong 's mansion was alongside orange grove boulevard , which is part of the route of pasadena 's annual new year 's day 'rose parade ' inside the concert hall , acoustically-designed side walls were made of rosewood these factions survived well past herbert armstrong 's death in 1986 , most retaining the name church of god because armstrong had pointed out that this is the name god calls his church in the bible most were unaware that herbert armstrong had been preaching about revelation and bible prophecy on the radio as far back as world war ii after the war ended , armstrong attended a meeting in san francisco in which a proposal was made to create the united nations he had also read a quote from winston churchill proposing the creation of a united states of europe while the european union was an idea in the making , the nations of europe were far from united , as the union itself was still another 20 years in the future armstrong never predicted a date in his sermons , nor did any of his evangelists '' the elder armstrong did not elaborate , but it was speculated that herbert was alluding to garner ted 's alleged problems with gambling and adultery with ambassador college co-eds , and to serious doctrinal differences while garner ted armstrong was removed , stanley rader was orchestrating the church 's involvement in a number of corporations which rader and herbert w critics saw rader 's moves as an attempt to seize control of the church herbert armstrong claimed that he did not approve of the establishment of the aicf , which rader set up ostensibly to give the elder armstrong a role as the '' ambassador for world peace without portfolio '' while armstrong recuperated in his home in arizona , he administered and guided church affairs through stanley rader and the church administration the church continued to be headquartered in pasadena garner ted armstrong began his own church in 1978 in tyler , texas , after the rivalry between the younger armstrong and stanley rader intensified armstrong started giving more responsibilities to stanley rader the adultery problems that reportedly had previously driven garner ted from the church allegedly continued unabated in 1978 , after a failed attempt to seize control of the church from the elder armstrong , garner ted armstrong was disfellowshipped a final time about this time the gap between father and son was set when garner ted threatened to expose the secret of herbert 's molesting his sister in the later 1930s armstrong and stanley rader to the attorney general of california several members in good standing with the worldwide church of god at the time prompted the state of california to investigate charges of malfeasance by rader and herbert w in 1979 , california attorney general george deukmejian placed the church campus in pasadena into financial receivership for a half year wallace showed rader a secret tape recording in which herbert armstrong clearly stated to c wayne cole , who was made temporary acting head of the church by herbert armstrong , that rader was attempting to take over the church after armstrong 's death , reasoning that the donated tithe money was the incentive and quite a '' magnet '' to stan rader armstrong , and c armstrong switched the worldwide church of god inc the church now claims that it is considered to be within the evangelical mainstream as shown by its

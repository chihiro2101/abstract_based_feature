armadillo aerospace designed and built more than 12 vehicles which used about 50 engine designs for over 100 rocket flights one was the use of modern computer technologies and electronics to simplify rocket control and reduce development costs another was the use of liquid propellants and vtvl to facilitate short launch-to-launch times a monopropellant-based engine requires only a single tank , as well as greatly simplified plumbing and other hardware armadillo aerospace competed in the 2006 x prize cup armadillo aerospace was the only competitor in the lunar lander challenge these flights were a highlight of the wirefly x-prize cup the quad vehicle design is pressure-fed in blow down mode from an initial pressure of 320 psi for level 1 ( 400 psi level 2 ) armadillo aerospace competed in the 2007 lunar lander challenge event in the wirefly x-prize cup 2007 the vehicle fell , and the impact broke open one of the alcohol tanks and a large fireball engulfed the vehicle texel crash video the vehicle was irreparably damaged , and only its sister pixel could compete in the upcoming event the plan was to have the first module ( of the next generation modular design ) compete at level 1 , and have pixel compete at level 2 challenge armadillo aerospace - news archive however their landing accuracy was not sufficient to win the first prize , instead they won the second prize while masten space systems ' xoie lander won the level 2 first prize in 2008 , the rocket racing league announced that armadillo aerospace engines would be used in a second generation of x-racer aircraft the super mod reusable launch vehicle is a vertical-takeoff , vertical-landing ( vtvl ) uncrewed rocket which was developed by armadillo in 2010â€“2011 on august 8 , 2006 , armadillo aerospace announced that it had reached a sponsorship deal with nvidia armadillo aerospace - news archive august 10 , 2010 the company mascot was an armadillo named widget in 2015 the assets of armadillo aerospace were sold to exos aerospace

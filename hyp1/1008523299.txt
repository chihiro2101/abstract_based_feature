armadillo aerospace designed and built more than 12 vehicles which used about 50 engine designs for over 100 rocket flights one was the use of modern computer technologies and electronics to simplify rocket control and reduce development costs armadillo stated a preference for simplicity and reliability over performance , which was evident in its choice of hydrogen peroxide ( 50 % concentration in water ) and methanol as a mixed monopropellant for the vehicle a monopropellant-based engine requires only a single tank , as well as greatly simplified plumbing and other hardware armadillo aerospace competed in the 2006 x prize cup armadillo aerospace was the only competitor in the lunar lander challenge the company took two similar vehicles , pixel and texel , to the event armadillo aerospace competed in the 2007 lunar lander challenge event in the wirefly x-prize cup 2007 the 2008 lunar lander challenge took place october 24â€“25 at the las cruces international airport in new mexico armadillo aerospace competed for the third year but for the first time had competition , from the truezer0 team armadillo had an unsuccessful first attempt at level 1 , and landed early due to inadequate thrust armadillo 's attempt at the level 2 prize on october 25 was aborted due to their vehicle toppling over after the engine casing burned through due to a fuel-line problem armadillo successfully flew both legs with their mod vehicle , each flight lasting over 180 seconds , landing safely however their landing accuracy was not sufficient to win the first prize , instead they won the second prize while masten space systems ' xoie lander won the level 2 first prize in 2008 , the rocket racing league announced that armadillo aerospace engines would be used in a second generation of x-racer aircraft armadillo had a relatively small budget and was not supported by aerospace companies or agencies like nasa , esa , or boeing in 2015 the assets of armadillo aerospace were sold to exos aerospace '' -- june 2006 armadillo aerospace update june 2006 armadillo aerospace update armadillo aerospace company , which is developing the suborbital spaceship for space tourist flights , announced on monday that a russian has become its first confirmed passenger

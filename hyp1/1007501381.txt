william phillips , a new zealand born economist , wrote a paper in 1958 titled the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom , 1861-1957 , which was published in the quarterly journal economica in the paper phillips describes how he observed an inverse relationship between money wage changes and unemployment in the british economy over the period examined similar patterns were found in other countries and in 1960 paul samuelson and robert solow took phillips ' work and made explicit the link between inflation and unemployment : when inflation was high , unemployment was low , and vice versa in the 1920s , an american economist irving fisher had noted this kind of phillips curve relationship however , phillips ' original curve described the behavior of money wages one implication of this for government policy was that governments could control unemployment and inflation with a keynesian policy they could tolerate a reasonably high rate of inflation as this would lead to lower unemployment – there would be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment moving along the phillips curve , this would lead to a higher inflation rate , the cost of enjoying lower unemployment rates since 1974 , seven nobel prizes have been given to economists for , among other things , work critical of some variations of the phillips curve some of this criticism is based on the united states ' experience during the 1970s , which had periods of high unemployment and high inflation at the same time in the 1970s , many countries experienced high levels of both inflation and unemployment also known as stagflation theories based on the phillips curve suggested that this could not happen , and the curve came under a concerted attack from a group of economists headed by milton friedman friedman argued that the phillips curve relationship was only a short-run phenomenon modern phillips curve models include both a short-run phillips curve and a long-run phillips curve this is because in the short run , there is generally an inverse relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate ; as illustrated in the downward sloping short-run phillips curve in the long run , that relationship breaks down and the economy eventually returns to the natural rate of unemployment regardless of the inflation rate the '' short-run phillips curve '' is also called the '' expectations-augmented phillips curve '' , since it shifts up when inflationary expectations rise , edmund phelps and milton friedman argued in the long run , this implies that monetary policy can not affect unemployment , which adjusts back to its '' natural rate '' , also called the '' nairu '' or '' long-run phillips curve '' in these macroeconomic models with sticky prices , there is a positive relation between the rate of inflation and the level of demand , and therefore a negative relation between the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment this relationship is often called the '' new keynesian phillips curve '' like the expectations-augmented phillips curve , the new keynesian phillips curve implies that increased inflation can lower unemployment temporarily , but can not lower it permanently the traditional phillips curve story starts with a wage phillips curve , of the sort described by phillips himself this equation tells us that the growth of money wages rises with the trend rate of growth of money wages ( indicated by the superscript t ) and falls with the unemployment rate ( u ) this produces the expectations-augmented wage phillips curve : : gw gw^t - f ( u ) + \lambda.gp^\text the long-run phillips curve was thus vertical , so there was no trade-off between inflation and unemployment however , according to the nairu , exploiting this short-run trade-off will raise inflation expectations , shifting the short-run curve rightward to the '' new short-run phillips curve '' and moving the point of equilibrium from b to c thus the reduction in unemployment below the '' natural rate '' will be temporary , and lead only to higher inflation in the long run this shifts the short-run phillips curve downward and leftward , so that less inflation is seen at each unemployment rate phillips , ‘ the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom 1861–1957 ’ ( 1958 ) 25 economica 283

william phillips , a new zealand born economist , wrote a paper in 1958 titled the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom , 1861-1957 , which was published in the quarterly journal economica in the paper phillips describes how he observed an inverse relationship between money wage changes and unemployment in the british economy over the period examined similar patterns were found in other countries and in 1960 paul samuelson and robert solow took phillips ' work and made explicit the link between inflation and unemployment : when inflation was high , unemployment was low , and vice versa however , phillips ' original curve described the behavior of money wages in the years following phillips ' 1958 paper , many economists in the advanced industrial countries believed that his results showed that there was a permanently stable relationship between inflation and unemployment one implication of this for government policy was that governments could control unemployment and inflation with a keynesian policy they could tolerate a reasonably high rate of inflation as this would lead to lower unemployment – there would be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment moving along the phillips curve , this would lead to a higher inflation rate , the cost of enjoying lower unemployment rates in the 1970s , many countries experienced high levels of both inflation and unemployment also known as stagflation theories based on the phillips curve suggested that this could not happen , and the curve came under a concerted attack from a group of economists headed by milton friedman friedman argued that the phillips curve relationship was only a short-run phenomenon in this he followed eight years after samuelson and solow 1960 who wrote '' all of our discussion has been phrased in short-run terms , dealing with what might happen in the next few years this result implies that over the longer-run there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment this implication is significant for practical reasons because it implies that central banks should not set unemployment targets below the natural rate most economists no longer use the phillips curve in its original form because it was shown to be too simplistic modern phillips curve models include both a short-run phillips curve and a long-run phillips curve this is because in the short run , there is generally an inverse relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate ; as illustrated in the downward sloping short-run phillips curve in the long run , this implies that monetary policy can not affect unemployment , which adjusts back to its '' natural rate '' , also called the '' nairu '' or '' long-run phillips curve '' this relationship is often called the '' new keynesian phillips curve '' like the expectations-augmented phillips curve , the new keynesian phillips curve implies that increased inflation can lower unemployment temporarily , but can not lower it permanently two influential papers that incorporate a new keynesian phillips curve are clarida , galí , and gertler ( 1999 ) , and blanchard and galí ( 2007 ) the traditional phillips curve the traditional phillips curve story starts with a wage phillips curve , of the sort described by phillips himself the latter theory , also known as the '' natural rate of unemployment '' , distinguished between the '' short-term '' phillips curve and the '' long-term '' one since the short-run curve shifts outward due to the attempt to reduce unemployment , the expansionary policy ultimately worsens the exploitable trade-off between unemployment and inflation eventually , workers discover that real wages have fallen , so they push for higher money wages ) high unemployment encourages low inflation , again as with a simple phillips curve this shifts the short-run phillips curve downward and leftward , so that less inflation is seen at each unemployment rate phillips , ‘ the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom 1861–1957 ’ ( 1958 ) 25 economica 283

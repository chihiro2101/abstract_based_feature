william phillips , a new zealand born economist , wrote a paper in 1958 titled the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom , 1861-1957 , which was published in the quarterly journal economica in the paper phillips describes how he observed an inverse relationship between money wage changes and unemployment in the british economy over the period examined similar patterns were found in other countries and in 1960 paul samuelson and robert solow took phillips ' work and made explicit the link between inflation and unemployment : when inflation was high , unemployment was low , and vice versa however , phillips ' original curve described the behavior of money wages one implication of this for government policy was that governments could control unemployment and inflation with a keynesian policy they could tolerate a reasonably high rate of inflation as this would lead to lower unemployment – there would be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment for example , monetary policy and/or fiscal policy could be used to stimulate the economy , raising gross domestic product and lowering the unemployment rate moving along the phillips curve , this would lead to a higher inflation rate , the cost of enjoying lower unemployment rates some of this criticism is based on the united states ' experience during the 1970s , which had periods of high unemployment and high inflation at the same time theories based on the phillips curve suggested that this could not happen , and the curve came under a concerted attack from a group of economists headed by milton friedman friedman argued that the phillips curve relationship was only a short-run phenomenon unemployment would then begin to rise back to its previous level , but now with higher inflation rates 2010.4 this can be seen in a cursory analysis of us inflation and unemployment data from 1953–92 the data for 1953–54 and 1972–73 do not group easily , and a more formal analysis posits up to five groups/curves over the period the theory goes under several names , with some variation in its details , but all modern versions distinguish between short-run and long-run effects on unemployment modern phillips curve models include both a short-run phillips curve and a long-run phillips curve this is because in the short run , there is generally an inverse relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate ; as illustrated in the downward sloping short-run phillips curve in the long run , that relationship breaks down and the economy eventually returns to the natural rate of unemployment regardless of the inflation rate the '' short-run phillips curve '' is also called the '' expectations-augmented phillips curve '' , since it shifts up when inflationary expectations rise , edmund phelps and milton friedman argued however , this long-run '' neutrality '' of monetary policy does allow for short run fluctuations and the ability of the monetary authority to temporarily decrease unemployment by increasing permanent inflation , and vice versa as keynes mentioned : '' a government has to remember , however , that even if a tax is not prohibited it may be unprofitable , and that a medium , rather than an extreme , imposition will yield the greatest gain '' in these macroeconomic models with sticky prices , there is a positive relation between the rate of inflation and the level of demand , and therefore a negative relation between the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment this relationship is often called the '' new keynesian phillips curve '' like the expectations-augmented phillips curve , the new keynesian phillips curve implies that increased inflation can lower unemployment temporarily , but can not lower it permanently one practical use of this model was to explain stagflation , which confounded the traditional phillips curve but if unemployment stays low and inflation stays high for a long time , as in the late 1960s in the u.s this shifts the short-run phillips curve downward and leftward , so that less inflation is seen at each unemployment rate the ends of this '' non-accelerating inflation range of unemployment rates '' change over time phillips , ‘ the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom 1861–1957 ’ ( 1958 ) 25 economica 283

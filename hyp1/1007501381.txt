william phillips , a new zealand born economist , wrote a paper in 1958 titled the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom , 1861-1957 , which was published in the quarterly journal economica in the paper phillips describes how he observed an inverse relationship between money wage changes and unemployment in the british economy over the period examined similar patterns were found in other countries and in 1960 paul samuelson and robert solow took phillips ' work and made explicit the link between inflation and unemployment : when inflation was high , unemployment was low , and vice versa however , phillips ' original curve described the behavior of money wages in the years following phillips ' 1958 paper , many economists in the advanced industrial countries believed that his results showed that there was a permanently stable relationship between inflation and unemployment they could tolerate a reasonably high rate of inflation as this would lead to lower unemployment – there would be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment moving along the phillips curve , this would lead to a higher inflation rate , the cost of enjoying lower unemployment rates economist james forder argues that this view is historically false and that neither economists nor governments took that view and that the 'phillips curve myth ' was an invention of the 1970s in the 1970s , many countries experienced high levels of both inflation and unemployment also known as stagflation friedman argued that the phillips curve relationship was only a short-run phenomenon what we do in a policy way during the next few years might cause it to shift in a definite way unemployment would then begin to rise back to its previous level , but now with higher inflation rates this implication is significant for practical reasons because it implies that central banks should not set unemployment targets below the natural rate most economists no longer use the phillips curve in its original form because it was shown to be too simplistic there is no single curve that will fit the data , but there are three rough aggregations—1955–71 , 1974–84 , and 1985–92—each of which shows a general , downwards slope , but at three very different levels with the shifts occurring abruptly but still today , modified forms of the phillips curve that take inflationary expectations into account remain influential modern phillips curve models include both a short-run phillips curve and a long-run phillips curve this is because in the short run , there is generally an inverse relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate ; as illustrated in the downward sloping short-run phillips curve the '' short-run phillips curve '' is also called the '' expectations-augmented phillips curve '' , since it shifts up when inflationary expectations rise , edmund phelps and milton friedman argued however , this long-run '' neutrality '' of monetary policy does allow for short run fluctuations and the ability of the monetary authority to temporarily decrease unemployment by increasing permanent inflation , and vice versa like the expectations-augmented phillips curve , the new keynesian phillips curve implies that increased inflation can lower unemployment temporarily , but can not lower it permanently the traditional phillips curve story starts with a wage phillips curve , of the sort described by phillips himself : gw gw^t - f ( u ) the '' money wage rate '' ( w ) is shorthand for total money wage costs per production employee , including benefits and payroll taxes since the 1970s , the equation has been changed to introduce the role of inflationary expectations ( or the expected inflation rate , gp ex ) the latter theory , also known as the '' natural rate of unemployment '' , distinguished between the '' short-term '' phillips curve and the '' long-term '' one the short-term phillips curve looked like a normal phillips curve but shifted in the long run as expectations changed the long-run phillips curve was thus vertical , so there was no trade-off between inflation and unemployment ) high unemployment encourages low inflation , again as with a simple phillips curve phillips , ‘ the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom 1861–1957 ’ ( 1958 ) 25 economica 283

william phillips , a new zealand born economist , wrote a paper in 1958 titled the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom , 1861-1957 , which was published in the quarterly journal economica in the paper phillips describes how he observed an inverse relationship between money wage changes and unemployment in the british economy over the period examined similar patterns were found in other countries and in 1960 paul samuelson and robert solow took phillips ' work and made explicit the link between inflation and unemployment : when inflation was high , unemployment was low , and vice versa however , phillips ' original curve described the behavior of money wages they could tolerate a reasonably high rate of inflation as this would lead to lower unemployment – there would be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment for example , monetary policy and/or fiscal policy could be used to stimulate the economy , raising gross domestic product and lowering the unemployment rate moving along the phillips curve , this would lead to a higher inflation rate , the cost of enjoying lower unemployment rates some of this criticism is based on the united states ' experience during the 1970s , which had periods of high unemployment and high inflation at the same time in the 1970s , many countries experienced high levels of both inflation and unemployment also known as stagflation friedman argued that the phillips curve relationship was only a short-run phenomenon this implication is significant for practical reasons because it implies that central banks should not set unemployment targets below the natural rate more recent research suggests that there is a moderate trade-off between low-levels of inflation and unemployment for example , a worker will more likely accept a wage increase of two percent when inflation is three percent , than a wage cut of one percent when the inflation rate is zero oliver hossfeld ( 2010 ) '' us money demand , monetary overhang , and inflation prediction '' international network for economic research working paper no there is no single curve that will fit the data , but there are three rough aggregations—1955–71 , 1974–84 , and 1985–92—each of which shows a general , downwards slope , but at three very different levels with the shifts occurring abruptly but still today , modified forms of the phillips curve that take inflationary expectations into account remain influential the theory goes under several names , with some variation in its details , but all modern versions distinguish between short-run and long-run effects on unemployment modern phillips curve models include both a short-run phillips curve and a long-run phillips curve this is because in the short run , there is generally an inverse relationship between inflation and the unemployment rate ; as illustrated in the downward sloping short-run phillips curve in the long run , that relationship breaks down and the economy eventually returns to the natural rate of unemployment regardless of the inflation rate the '' short-run phillips curve '' is also called the '' expectations-augmented phillips curve '' , since it shifts up when inflationary expectations rise , edmund phelps and milton friedman argued in the long run , this implies that monetary policy can not affect unemployment , which adjusts back to its '' natural rate '' , also called the '' nairu '' or '' long-run phillips curve '' however , this long-run '' neutrality '' of monetary policy does allow for short run fluctuations and the ability of the monetary authority to temporarily decrease unemployment by increasing permanent inflation , and vice versa the popular textbook of blanchard gives a textbook presentation of the expectations-augmented phillips curve the traditional phillips curve story starts with a wage phillips curve , of the sort described by phillips himself the short-term phillips curve looked like a normal phillips curve but shifted in the long run as expectations changed however , according to the nairu , exploiting this short-run trade-off will raise inflation expectations , shifting the short-run curve rightward to the '' new short-run phillips curve '' and moving the point of equilibrium from b to c this shifts the short-run phillips curve upward and rightward , so that more inflation is seen at any given unemployment rate phillips , ‘ the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom 1861–1957 ’ ( 1958 ) 25 economica 283

william phillips , a new zealand born economist , wrote a paper in 1958 titled the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom , 1861-1957 , which was published in the quarterly journal economica in the 1920s , an american economist irving fisher had noted this kind of phillips curve relationship however , phillips ' original curve described the behavior of money wages in the years following phillips ' 1958 paper , many economists in the advanced industrial countries believed that his results showed that there was a permanently stable relationship between inflation and unemployment one implication of this for government policy was that governments could control unemployment and inflation with a keynesian policy they could tolerate a reasonably high rate of inflation as this would lead to lower unemployment – there would be a trade-off between inflation and unemployment for example , monetary policy and/or fiscal policy could be used to stimulate the economy , raising gross domestic product and lowering the unemployment rate moving along the phillips curve , this would lead to a higher inflation rate , the cost of enjoying lower unemployment rates economist james forder argues that this view is historically false and that neither economists nor governments took that view and that the 'phillips curve myth ' was an invention of the 1970s since 1974 , seven nobel prizes have been given to economists for , among other things , work critical of some variations of the phillips curve some of this criticism is based on the united states ' experience during the 1970s , which had periods of high unemployment and high inflation at the same time the authors receiving those prizes include thomas sargent , christopher sims , edmund phelps , edward prescott , robert a theories based on the phillips curve suggested that this could not happen , and the curve came under a concerted attack from a group of economists headed by milton friedman this result implies that over the longer-run there is no trade-off between inflation and unemployment this implication is significant for practical reasons because it implies that central banks should not set unemployment targets below the natural rate most economists no longer use the phillips curve in its original form because it was shown to be too simplistic 2010.4 this can be seen in a cursory analysis of us inflation and unemployment data from 1953–92 modern phillips curve models include both a short-run phillips curve and a long-run phillips curve the '' short-run phillips curve '' is also called the '' expectations-augmented phillips curve '' , since it shifts up when inflationary expectations rise , edmund phelps and milton friedman argued in the long run , this implies that monetary policy can not affect unemployment , which adjusts back to its '' natural rate '' , also called the '' nairu '' or '' long-run phillips curve '' an equation like the expectations-augmented phillips curve also appears in many recent new keynesian dynamic stochastic general equilibrium models in these macroeconomic models with sticky prices , there is a positive relation between the rate of inflation and the level of demand , and therefore a negative relation between the rate of inflation and the rate of unemployment this relationship is often called the '' new keynesian phillips curve '' like the expectations-augmented phillips curve , the new keynesian phillips curve implies that increased inflation can lower unemployment temporarily , but can not lower it permanently the traditional phillips curve in the long run , only a single rate of unemployment ( the nairu or '' natural '' rate ) was consistent with a stable inflation rate ) high unemployment encourages low inflation , again as with a simple phillips curve but if unemployment stays high and inflation stays low for a long time , as in the early 1980s in the u.s phillips , ‘ the relation between unemployment and the rate of change of money wage rates in the united kingdom 1861–1957 ’ ( 1958 ) 25 economica 283

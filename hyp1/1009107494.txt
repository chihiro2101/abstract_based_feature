an evoked potential is the electrical response of the brain to a sensory stimulus regan constructed an analogue fourier series analyzer to record harmonics of the evoked potential to flickering ( sinusoidally modulated ) light this allowed him to demonstrate that the brain attained a steady-state regime in which the amplitude and phase of the harmonics ( frequency components ) of the response were approximately constant over time by analogy with the steady-state response of a resonant circuit that follows the initial transient response he defined an idealized steady-state evoked potential ( ssep ) as a form of response to repetitive sensory stimulation in which the constituent frequency components of the response remain constant with time in both amplitude and phase although this definition implies a series of identical temporal waveforms , it is more helpful to define the ssep in terms of the frequency components that are an alternative description of the time-domain waveform , because different frequency components can have quite different properties human brain electrophysiology : evoked potentials and evoked magnetic fields in science and medicine since a ssep can be completely described in terms of the amplitude and phase of each frequency component it can be quantified more unequivocally than an averaged transient evoked potential repetitive sensory stimulation elicits a steady-state magnetic brain response that can be analysed in the same way as the ssep different sites of stimulation or different stimuli can be tagged with slightly different frequencies that are virtually identical to the brain , but easily separated by fourier series analyzers for example , when two unpatterned lights are modulated at slightly different frequencies ( f1 and f2 ) and superimposed , multiple nonlinear cross-modulation components of frequency ( mf1 ± nf2 ) are created in the ssep , where m and n are integers the existence of a ( 2fv + 2fa ) component in the evoked magnetic brain response demonstrated an audio-visual convergence area in the human brain , and the distribution of this response over the head allowed this brain area to be localized a plot of , for example , response amplitude versus the check size of a stimulus checkerboard pattern plot can be obtained in 10 seconds , far faster than when time-domain averaging is used to record an evoked potential for each of several check sizes a single sweep may be adequate or it may be necessary to average the graphs obtained in several sweeps with the averager triggered by the sweep cycle the sweep technique has proved useful in measuring rapidly adapting visual processes and also for recording from babies , where recording duration is necessarily short for example , the running average of the ssep can be arranged to increase the luminance of a checkerboard stimulus if the amplitude of the ssep falls below some predetermined value , and to decrease luminance if it rises above this value the resulting plot of stimulus luminance versus wavelength is a plot of the spectral sensitivity of the visual system auditory evoked potentials by a click or tone stimulus presented through earphones ) , or tactile or somatosensory evoked potential ( ssep ) elicited by tactile or electrical stimulation of a sensory or mixed nerve in the periphery sensory evoked potentials have been widely used in clinical diagnosis medicine since the 1970s , and also in intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring ( ionm ) , also known as surgical neurophysiology there are three kinds of evoked potentials in widespread clinical use : auditory evoked potentials , usually recorded from the scalp but originating at brainstem level ; visual evoked potentials , and somatosensory evoked potentials , which are elicited by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve long and allen were the first investigators to report the abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( baeps ) in an alcoholic woman who recovered from acquired central hypoventilation syndrome visual evoked potential ( vep ) is an evoked potential elicited by presenting light flash or pattern stimulus which can be used to confirm damage to visual pathway including retina , optic nerve , optic chiasm , optic radiations , and occipital cortex vep can be sensitive to visual dysfunctions that may not be found with just physical examinations or mri , even if it can not indicate etiologies an attempt to localize structures in the primary visual pathway was completed by szikla and colleagues a wide variety of extensive research to improve procedures and theories has been conducted from the 1970s to today and the method has also been described in animals the diffuse-light flash stimulus is rarely used nowadays due to the high variability within and across subjects erps are brain responses that are time-locked to some '' event '' , such as a sensory stimulus , a mental event ( such as recognition of a target stimulus ) , or the omission of a stimulus they are recorded by stimulating peripheral nerves , most commonly the tibial nerve , median nerve or ulnar nerve , typically with an electrical stimulus in the central nervous system they can detect damage to the spinothalamic tract , lateral brain stem , and fibers carrying pain and temperature signals from the thalamus to the cortex motor evoked potentials ( mep ) are recorded from muscles following direct stimulation of exposed motor cortex , or transcranial stimulation of motor cortex , either magnetic or electrical it has become clear that these '' motor '' potentials were almost entirely elicited by antidromic stimulation of sensory tracts—even when the recording was from muscles ( antidromic sensory tract stimulation triggers myogenic responses through synapses at the root entry level )

an evoked potential is the electrical response of the brain to a sensory stimulus regan constructed an analogue fourier series analyzer to record harmonics of the evoked potential to flickering ( sinusoidally modulated ) light this allowed him to demonstrate that the brain attained a steady-state regime in which the amplitude and phase of the harmonics ( frequency components ) of the response were approximately constant over time by analogy with the steady-state response of a resonant circuit that follows the initial transient response he defined an idealized steady-state evoked potential ( ssep ) as a form of response to repetitive sensory stimulation in which the constituent frequency components of the response remain constant with time in both amplitude and phase although this definition implies a series of identical temporal waveforms , it is more helpful to define the ssep in terms of the frequency components that are an alternative description of the time-domain waveform , because different frequency components can have quite different properties human brain electrophysiology : evoked potentials and evoked magnetic fields in science and medicine since a ssep can be completely described in terms of the amplitude and phase of each frequency component it can be quantified more unequivocally than an averaged transient evoked potential because of the high-frequency rolloff of the ssep , high frequency stimulation can produce a near-sinusoidal ssep waveform , but this is not germane to the definition of a ssep repetitive sensory stimulation elicits a steady-state magnetic brain response that can be analysed in the same way as the ssep different sites of stimulation or different stimuli can be tagged with slightly different frequencies that are virtually identical to the brain , but easily separated by fourier series analyzers for example , a visual stimulus was flickered at fv hz and a simultaneously presented auditory tone was amplitude modulated at fa hz the existence of a ( 2fv + 2fa ) component in the evoked magnetic brain response demonstrated an audio-visual convergence area in the human brain , and the distribution of this response over the head allowed this brain area to be localized a plot of , for example , response amplitude versus the check size of a stimulus checkerboard pattern plot can be obtained in 10 seconds , far faster than when time-domain averaging is used to record an evoked potential for each of several check sizes in the original demonstration of the technique the sine and cosine products were fed through lowpass filters ( as when recording a ssep ) while viewing a pattern of fine checks whose black and white squares exchanged place six times per second then the size of the squares was progressively increased so as to give a plot of evoked potential amplitude versus check size ( hence '' sweep '' ) subsequent authors have implemented the sweep technique by using computer software to increment the spatial frequency of a grating in a series of small steps and to compute a time-domain average for each discrete spatial frequency norcia and tyler have used the technique to document the development of visual acuity and contrast sensitivity through the first years of life for example , the running average of the ssep can be arranged to increase the luminance of a checkerboard stimulus if the amplitude of the ssep falls below some predetermined value , and to decrease luminance if it rises above this value the resulting plot of stimulus luminance versus wavelength is a plot of the spectral sensitivity of the visual system auditory evoked potentials by a click or tone stimulus presented through earphones ) , or tactile or somatosensory evoked potential ( ssep ) elicited by tactile or electrical stimulation of a sensory or mixed nerve in the periphery sensory evoked potentials have been widely used in clinical diagnosis medicine since the 1970s , and also in intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring ( ionm ) , also known as surgical neurophysiology there are three kinds of evoked potentials in widespread clinical use : auditory evoked potentials , usually recorded from the scalp but originating at brainstem level ; visual evoked potentials , and somatosensory evoked potentials , which are elicited by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve examples of sep usage include : ssep can be used to locate lesions such as peripheral nerve or spinal cord long and allen were the first investigators to report the abnormal brainstem auditory evoked potentials ( baeps ) in an alcoholic woman who recovered from acquired central hypoventilation syndrome visual evoked potential ( vep ) is an evoked potential elicited by presenting light flash or pattern stimulus which can be used to confirm damage to visual pathway including retina , optic nerve , optic chiasm , optic radiations , and occipital cortex during that same year , hirsch and colleagues recorded a visual evoked potential ( vep ) on the occipital lobe ( externally and internally ) , and they discovered amplitudes recorded along the calcarine fissure were the largest for example , p100 is a wave with a positive peak at approximately 100 ms following stimulus onset motor evoked potentials ( mep ) are recorded from muscles following direct stimulation of exposed motor cortex , or transcranial stimulation of motor cortex , either magnetic or electrical during the 1990s , there were attempts to monitor '' motor evoked potentials '' , including '' neurogenic motor evoked potentials '' recorded from peripheral nerves , following direct electrical stimulation of the spinal cord this technique is known as transcranial electrical motor potential ( tcmep ) monitoring

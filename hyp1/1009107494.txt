an evoked potential is the electrical response of the brain to a sensory stimulus regan constructed an analogue fourier series analyzer to record harmonics of the evoked potential to flickering ( sinusoidally modulated ) light this allowed him to demonstrate that the brain attained a steady-state regime in which the amplitude and phase of the harmonics ( frequency components ) of the response were approximately constant over time by analogy with the steady-state response of a resonant circuit that follows the initial transient response he defined an idealized steady-state evoked potential ( ssep ) as a form of response to repetitive sensory stimulation in which the constituent frequency components of the response remain constant with time in both amplitude and phase although this definition implies a series of identical temporal waveforms , it is more helpful to define the ssep in terms of the frequency components that are an alternative description of the time-domain waveform , because different frequency components can have quite different properties human brain electrophysiology : evoked potentials and evoked magnetic fields in science and medicine since a ssep can be completely described in terms of the amplitude and phase of each frequency component it can be quantified more unequivocally than an averaged transient evoked potential it is sometimes said that sseps are elicited only by stimuli of high repetition frequency , but this is not generally correct in principle , a sinusoidally modulated stimulus can elicit a ssep even when its repetition frequency is low because of the high-frequency rolloff of the ssep , high frequency stimulation can produce a near-sinusoidal ssep waveform , but this is not germane to the definition of a ssep different sites of stimulation or different stimuli can be tagged with slightly different frequencies that are virtually identical to the brain , but easily separated by fourier series analyzers for example , when two unpatterned lights are modulated at slightly different frequencies ( f1 and f2 ) and superimposed , multiple nonlinear cross-modulation components of frequency ( mf1 Â± nf2 ) are created in the ssep , where m and n are integers by frequency-tagging two superimposed gratings , spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties of the brain mechanisms that process spatial form can be isolated and studied stimuli of different sensory modalities can also be tagged for example , a visual stimulus was flickered at fv hz and a simultaneously presented auditory tone was amplitude modulated at fa hz then the size of the squares was progressively increased so as to give a plot of evoked potential amplitude versus check size ( hence '' sweep '' ) subsequent authors have implemented the sweep technique by using computer software to increment the spatial frequency of a grating in a series of small steps and to compute a time-domain average for each discrete spatial frequency the resulting plot of stimulus luminance versus wavelength is a plot of the spectral sensitivity of the visual system auditory evoked potentials by a click or tone stimulus presented through earphones ) , or tactile or somatosensory evoked potential ( ssep ) elicited by tactile or electrical stimulation of a sensory or mixed nerve in the periphery sensory evoked potentials have been widely used in clinical diagnosis medicine since the 1970s , and also in intraoperative neurophysiology monitoring ( ionm ) , also known as surgical neurophysiology examples of sep usage include : ssep can be used to locate lesions such as peripheral nerve or spinal cord in both types of injury , normal responses may indicate good outcome visual evoked potential ( vep ) is an evoked potential elicited by presenting light flash or pattern stimulus which can be used to confirm damage to visual pathway including retina , optic nerve , optic chiasm , optic radiations , and occipital cortex for example , patients with acute severe optic neuritis often lose the p100 response or have highly attenuated responses during that same year , hirsch and colleagues recorded a visual evoked potential ( vep ) on the occipital lobe ( externally and internally ) , and they discovered amplitudes recorded along the calcarine fissure were the largest however , it is beneficial to use this type of stimulus when testing infants , animals or individuals with poor visual acuity somatosensory evoked potentials ( sseps ) are ep recorded from the brain or spinal cord when stimulating peripheral nerve repeatedly during the 1990s , there were attempts to monitor '' motor evoked potentials '' , including '' neurogenic motor evoked potentials '' recorded from peripheral nerves , following direct electrical stimulation of the spinal cord tcmep , whether electrical or magnetic , is the most practical way to ensure pure motor responses , since stimulation of sensory cortex can not result in descending impulses beyond the first synapse ( synapses can not be backfired ) sensory evoked potentials may also be used during surgeries which place brain structures at risk

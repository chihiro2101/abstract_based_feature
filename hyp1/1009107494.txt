an evoked potential is the electrical response of the brain to a sensory stimulus this allowed him to demonstrate that the brain attained a steady-state regime in which the amplitude and phase of the harmonics ( frequency components ) of the response were approximately constant over time although this definition implies a series of identical temporal waveforms , it is more helpful to define the ssep in terms of the frequency components that are an alternative description of the time-domain waveform , because different frequency components can have quite different properties human brain electrophysiology : evoked potentials and evoked magnetic fields in science and medicine since a ssep can be completely described in terms of the amplitude and phase of each frequency component it can be quantified more unequivocally than an averaged transient evoked potential it is sometimes said that sseps are elicited only by stimuli of high repetition frequency , but this is not generally correct in principle , a sinusoidally modulated stimulus can elicit a ssep even when its repetition frequency is low because of the high-frequency rolloff of the ssep , high frequency stimulation can produce a near-sinusoidal ssep waveform , but this is not germane to the definition of a ssep different sites of stimulation or different stimuli can be tagged with slightly different frequencies that are virtually identical to the brain , but easily separated by fourier series analyzers by frequency-tagging two superimposed gratings , spatial frequency and orientation tuning properties of the brain mechanisms that process spatial form can be isolated and studied stimuli of different sensory modalities can also be tagged for example , a visual stimulus was flickered at fv hz and a simultaneously presented auditory tone was amplitude modulated at fa hz more recently , frequency tagging has been extended from studies of sensory processing to studies of selective attention and of consciousness a plot of , for example , response amplitude versus the check size of a stimulus checkerboard pattern plot can be obtained in 10 seconds , far faster than when time-domain averaging is used to record an evoked potential for each of several check sizes then the size of the squares was progressively increased so as to give a plot of evoked potential amplitude versus check size ( hence '' sweep '' ) evoked potentials : vision auditory evoked potentials by a click or tone stimulus presented through earphones ) , or tactile or somatosensory evoked potential ( ssep ) elicited by tactile or electrical stimulation of a sensory or mixed nerve in the periphery there are three kinds of evoked potentials in widespread clinical use : auditory evoked potentials , usually recorded from the scalp but originating at brainstem level ; visual evoked potentials , and somatosensory evoked potentials , which are elicited by electrical stimulation of peripheral nerve examples of sep usage include : ssep can be used to locate lesions such as peripheral nerve or spinal cord short latency eps such as ssep , vep , and baep can be used to indicate prognosis for traumatic and anoxic brain injury visual evoked potential ( vep ) is an evoked potential elicited by presenting light flash or pattern stimulus which can be used to confirm damage to visual pathway including retina , optic nerve , optic chiasm , optic radiations , and occipital cortex cited it can be used to examine infant 's visual impairment for abnormal visual pathways which may be due to delayed maturation for example , patients with acute severe optic neuritis often lose the p100 response or have highly attenuated responses clinical recovery and visual improvement come with p100 restoration but with an abnormal increased latency that continues indefinitely , and hence , it maybe useful as an indicator of previous or subclinical optic neuritis during that same year , hirsch and colleagues recorded a visual evoked potential ( vep ) on the occipital lobe ( externally and internally ) , and they discovered amplitudes recorded along the calcarine fissure were the largest in a typical ( one channel ) setup , one electrode is placed 2.5 & nbsp ; cm above the inion and a reference electrode is placed at fz aeps ( and erps ) are very small electrical voltage potentials originating from the brain recorded from the scalp in response to an auditory stimulus , such as different tones , speech sounds , etc in the central nervous system they can detect damage to the spinothalamic tract , lateral brain stem , and fibers carrying pain and temperature signals from the thalamus to the cortex it has become clear that these '' motor '' potentials were almost entirely elicited by antidromic stimulation of sensory tractsâ€”even when the recording was from muscles ( antidromic sensory tract stimulation triggers myogenic responses through synapses at the root entry level ) sensory evoked potentials may also be used during surgeries which place brain structures at risk
